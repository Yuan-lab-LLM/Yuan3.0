75 % on u . s . # 20 , 10 - 30 % on u . s . # 30 , and 10 % maximum in the pan at an overall density of about 30 - 32 lb / cu . ft . rolled oats come in a variety of commercially available thicknesses . all of these thicknesses are useful in the process according to the invention . rolled oats are available as &# 34 ; thick table rolled &# 34 ;, &# 34 ; regular rolled &# 34 ;, and &# 34 ; quick cooking oats &# 34 ; in order of decreasing thickness . the thick rolled oats are preferred as they retain their texture and overall flavorful contribution while being less susceptible to processing damage . a desirable granulation of thick table rolled oats is about 80 % minimum on a u . s . # 8 sieve and 10 % maximum passing through a u . s . # 20 sieve . in the method for optionally &# 34 ; aseptically &# 34 ; processing oats and oat fractions into a flavorful oatmeal composition , the first step is to hydrate steel cut oats , for example , by soaking in water for up to about 45 minutes at about 65 - 85 ° f . steel cut oats are well known in the industry as oat particulates produced by cutting whole groats from clean , sound oats without rolling . a preferred form of steel cut oat is commercially known as a &# 34 ; table steel cut oat groat &# 34 ;. a desirable granulation size is about 8 % by weight maximum over a u . s . # 7 sieve and 25 % maximum through a u . s . # 12 sieve . steel cut oats are used in the invention to add texture to the resulting food product . to the soaking steel cut oats can be added an optional flavor fraction . a wide variety of flavors agents may be present but preferably comprise cinnamon , honey or other sweetening material , salt , and vanilla in proportions to taste . cinnamon is desirably present in virtually any physical form at a weight ratio with respect to the overall composition of about 0 . 2 to 0 . 6 %, while honey is desirably added in a weight ratio of about 4 to 12 %. salt can be used in a weight ratio of up to about 0 . 26 % depending on flavor and dietary considerations for the product . vanilla can be added in a weight ratio of 0 . 4 to 1 . 2 %, depending on the vanilla flavor concentration ( fold ). it should be understood that the flavor fraction may contain other ingredients or use widely different proportions for the listed components . taste , style , and economic factors will tend to guide the formulation of the flavor fraction if added to the product at all . oat bran is preferably added to the hydrating steel cut oats after the cut oats have been soaking for about 7 to 12 minutes . oat bran is water soluble and should be added in such a manner as to avoid clumping . mild agitation is preferred to break up any clumps that may have formed yet avoid harm to the added oat bran . it is not desirable to have a high rate of agitation as the oat bran will break up and solubilize to the detriment of the resulting flavor . any coarseness or granulation of oat bran can be used depending on the taste and texture desired in the final product . a preferred granulation has 10 % maximum on u . s . # 10 , 55 - 75 % on u . s . # 20 , 10 - 30 % on u . s . # 30 , and 10 % maximum in the pan at an overall density of about 30 - 32 lb / cu . ft . when the steel cut oats and oat bran have been mixed and soaked , the cut oat / bran mixture is desirably transferred to a holding reservoir . this transfer step may be through a series of pipes or other handling apparatus . the rate and amount of shear that is induced is desirably minimized to preserve the texture of the steel cut oats and the oat bran while assuring adequate mixing to avoid clumping . rolled oats ( otherwise known as oat flakes ) can be added at any point in the process before cooking the mixture . desirably , they are added to the cut oat / bran mixture in the holding reservoir . the rolled oats are even more preferably added before the cut oat / bran mix is passed to the reservoir to minimize shear forces on the flakes and thereby preserve their texture . the oat mixture containing cut oats , bran , and flakes is then heated to a temperature of about 250 ° to 325 ° f . for a time sufficient to cook the oatmeal fractions , e . g . for 15 seconds to about 2 minutes , depending on the temperature . it is preferable to maintain aseptic conditions during the cooking and avoid the introduction of any microorganisms or bacteria which could adversely affect the food product . for that reason , conventional aseptic processing equipment such as closed kettles and heating tubes are desirably used . this aseptic product has a shelf like under refrigeration at 40 °- 50 ° f . of about 4 - 6 months . if the storage conditions of the aseptically packaged product are likely to be at temperatures above 75 ° f . for an extended period of time , it may be desirable to add a small quantity of preservative to ensure the safety of the food composition . among the well known , suitable preservatives are potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate . further , where aseptic packaging conditions are not used , conventional preservatives may be added according to conventional protocols as is customary in the industry to preserve product freshness . in the retort preparation , the steel cut oats and oat bran mixture is heated to a temperature of about 150 ° f . to about 220 ° f ., preferably at least 180 ° f . the rolled oats are then added , and the entire mixture is simmered for about 2 to 5 minutes . preferably , the mixture is simmered for about 3 minutes . the mixture is subsequently placed into containers such as bowls or pouches designed as retail or wholesale packaging for the product and additionally cooked for a time sufficient to produce an edible composition . cooking time in the containers is affected by container size and thickness , with larger and / or denser containers requiring longer cooking times . preferred cooking time in containers is about 13 minutes to 1 hour and 25 minutes . preferred cooking temperature is at least about 250 ° f ., more preferably 250 ° to about 310 ° f . further , rotation of the container may be performed , which rotation further shortens cooking time . rotation of the containers of up to 15 rpm may be used . flavorings may be added , as discussed above . in addition , raisins may be included in the composition at any point in the preparation . where raisins are to be added , they are preferably added in the final stages of the procedure . when cooking is complete , the containers are sealed and may be heated to sanitize the contents . alternatively , conventional preservatives may be added . in both the optional aseptic and retort processes above , it is desirable to add the rolled oats at a point in the preparation so that their processing is minimized , in order to avoid production of a paste - like product . although the specific order of the steps discussed above represents the preferred methods of practicing the invention , other variations which would delay processing of the rolled oats are also intended to be encompassed within the invention . for example , the steel - cut oats may be cooked separately , combined with previously hydrated oat bran , and then cooked with rolled oats for a short time . in the &# 34 ; hot fill &# 34 ; and &# 34 ; fresh pack &# 34 ; processes , when the steel cut oats and oat bran have been mixed and soaked , the cut oat / bran mixture may be transferred to a holding reservoir or cooking apparatus , e . g ., an open kettle . this transfer step may be through a series of pipes or other handling apparatus . the rate and amount of shear that is induced is desirably minimized to preserve the texture of the steel cut oats and the oat bran while assuring adequate mixing to avoid clumping . rolled oats ( otherwise known as oat flakes ) are added to the cut oat / bran mixture in the cooking apparatus . the rolled oats are even more preferably added before the cut oat / bran mix is passed to the reservoir , where a reservoir is used , to minimize shear forces on the flakes and thereby preserve their texture . in both the hot - fill and fresh pack processes , it is desirable to add the rolled oats at a point in the preparation so that their processing is minimized , in order to avoid production of a paste - like product . although the specific order of the processing steps discussed below represents the preferred method of practicing the invention , other variations which would delay processing of the rolled oats are also intended to be encompassed within the invention . for example , the steel - cut oats may be first hydrated , combined with the oat bran , and then cooked , with subsequent addition of rolled oats and optionally further cooking for a short time . in a preferred embodiment of the fresh pack process , the steel cut oats and water are cooked at a rolling boil for about 5 to 15 minutes , preferably about 10 minutes , at about 15 - 18 psi . the rolled oats are then added and the mixture is cooked for an additional approximately 3 to 8 minutes . the oat bran is then added and cooking is continued for up to about 3 minutes . preferably , the bran is previously hydrated to shorten cooking time , e . g ., soaked for about 1 to 5 minutes in hot water . the mixture is then transferred to containers , e . g ., through a pump system and chilled to about 40 ° to 85 ° f ., preferably to approximately 50 ° to 80 ° f . the container and oatmeal may be cooled using a variety of conventional container cooling techniques , e . g ., contact with cold water or gas , refrigeration , etc . depending on the desired end use of the product , the containers may be large pails for food service applications or retail packs for consumer use . where such packaging is not sterile , preservatives are added , generally to the cooking apparatus during processing . among the well known , suitable preservatives are potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate . these and other conventional preservatives may be added according to conventional protocols as is customary in the industry to preserve product freshness . in a preferred embodiment of the hot fill technique , the oatmeal composition can be acidified with suitable ph modifier using an open kettle for the cooking . suitable ph modifiers include glucono delta lactone , apple butter , apple pectin , any naturally acidic flavorings , and combinations thereof . the resulting product can then be filled into containers at an elevated temperature , e . g ., about 140 ° to 160 ° f ., sealed with a removable plastic film , and inverted . preferably , the container is hot filled with about 80 - 98 vol . % oatmeal with the remainder being air that is naturally drawn into the container during the filling step and becomes heated to the oatmeal temperature . an inversion step permits hot air within the container to rise through the oatmeal composition and kill any bacteria that might have been introduced as a result of the open kettle cooking . the result of the inversion is a sterile package . the hot fill product according to the invention has a refrigerated shelf life of approximately 4 - 6 months for a 24 ounce container . the product can be opened and heated on a conventional stove or in a microwave oven set at high for about 45 to 90 seconds depending on the oven power . additional flavoring agents may be added to the cooked product if desired . in either process , an optional flavor fraction may be added during processing , preferably to the steel cut oats . a wide variety of flavors agents may be present but preferably comprise cinnamon , honey or other sweetening material , salt , and vanilla in proportions to taste . cinnamon is desirably present in virtually any physical form at a weight ratio with respect to the overall composition of about 0 . 2 to 0 . 6 %, while honey is desirably added in a weight ratio of about 4 to 12 %. salt can be used in a weight ratio of up to about 0 . 26 % depending on flavor and dietary considerations for the product . vanilla can be added in a weight ratio of 0 . 4 to 1 . 2 %, depending on the vanilla flavor concentration ( fold ). it should be understood that the flavor fraction may contain other ingredients or use widely different proportions for the listed components . taste , style , and economic factors will tend to guide the formulation of the flavor fraction if added to the product at all . in addition , raisins may be included in the composition at any point in the preparation . where raisins are to be added , they are preferably added in the final stages of the procedure . without further elaboration , it is believed that one skilled in the art can , using the preceding description , utilize the present invention to its fullest extent . the following preferred specific embodiments are , therefore , to be construed as merely illustrative , and not limitative , of the remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever . the entire texts of all applications , patents and publications , if any , cited above and below , are hereby incorporated by reference . table 1______________________________________ingredient wt . % ______________________________________water 73 . 9steel cut oat groats 8 . 0thick rolled oats 8 . 0wildflower honey 8 . 0oat bran 0 . 76mccormick vanilla extract ( v -

{"description": "the present invention provides an electrolyte gel based on a crosslinked natural gum as the thickening agent . the preferred gums are guar gum and locust bean gum . structurally , the useful natural gums are high polymeric saccharides comprised of hexose , pentose or uronic acid groups linked together . one feature of the natural gums is their ready availability and low cost . a feature of guar gum is that it can be obtained in a rather pure state without extensive processing . guar gum in its natural state is relatively pure , having very few impurities such as sulphur ( sometimes found in agar ) or extraneous ions ( as found in many of the less pure gums ). a useful practical feature of guar gum gels is that they can be produced at room temperature or at only slightly raised temperature due to the fact that guar gum powder mixes well with room temperature water unlike synthetic gels such as polyvinyl alcohol which requires heating and more complicated production techniques . in addition , the natural ph of guar gum gels of this invention is approximately 7 - 8 . 5 , which is an excellent ph range for a composition to be used against the skin since it is close to the physiological ph . gels of the prior art have been neutralized or buffered in order to achieve an acceptable ph . natural gums are polysaccharides obtained from natural substances . for example , guar gum is a polysaccharide obtained from the seeds of the guar plant . the structure of guar gum , as illustrated below , is that of a chain mannose sacharide polymer with repeating single - unit galactose branches , referred to as galactomannan . ## str1 ## guar gum is available in anionic , cationic and nonionic forms . the nonionic type has been found most suitable for use with ag / agcl electrodes and is preferred for use with sensitive biomonitoring electrodes . applicant has surprisingly found that gels made from a hydroxy - propylated nonionic guar gum , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® hp - 11 , are stable to concentrations of chloride ion greater than 10 percent by weight . thus , this guar gum gel can be successfully utilized where the transmission of high currents is desired ( i . e ., high salt concentrations are required ) without breakdown of the gel &# 39 ; s cohesive structure . however , in applications where the electrodes are to contact the skin for periods longer than an hour , lower concentrations , 0 . 1 - 5 percent by weight , of chloride ion are preferred . the lower concentrations of chloride are also preferred for electrodes which have been gelled and stored a long time prior to use in order to avoid corrosion effects on other parts of the electrode . both anionic and cationic guars are also useful as conductive gels . anionic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® cmhp , and cationic guar , sold by the stein hall co . under the trademark jaguar ® c - 13 , have been successfully tested . additionally , even a food - grade guar has been used successfully . gels made from these gums are of different viscosities and achieve peak viscosity at different times than do gels made from nonionic guar gum . mixtures of crosslinkable natural gums with other thickeners are also within the scope of the present invention . for example , the addition of polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) to guar gum increases the cohesive strength of the final gel , and decreases its cold flow . this formulation is not particularly advantageous for biomonitoring electrodes , but can be valuable in electrodes where the gel is under high compressive loads , such as in electrosurgery or in transcutaneous nerve stimulation . other thickeners which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums include hydroxyethyl cellulose , and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose . examples of other natural gums which can be mixed with the crosslinkable natural gums of the present invention include gum arabic , sodium alginate and gum tragacanth . the gels of the present invention have increased internal cohesiveness and are able to be easily removed from surfaces with which they come in contact due to their crosslinked nature . the preferred crosslinking agent is borate ion , supplied by potassium tetraborate or sodium tetraborate . borate ion reacts effectively with the preferred gums , guar gum and locust bean gum , to form stable gels . in addition compositions crosslinked with borate are acceptable for contact with human skin . the exact nature of the crosslinking of guar gum with borate ion is not well understood . a degree of ester formation between the borate anions and the hydroxyl groups of the gums is possible . the formation of coordinate bonds would also account for the observed crosslinking effect . it is noted that polysaccharides with cis - hydroxyl groups on adjacent chains , such as guar gum and locust bean gum , are those most usefully crosslinked by borate ions for purposes of this invention . that is , gels made with polysaccharides having cis - hydroxyl groups exhibit the greatest degree of crosslinking ( e . g ., the stiffest gel is produced ) for given concentrations of gum and borate . it is possible that borate ion reacts with polysaccharides containing cis - hydroxyl groups to form bridges between adjacent cis - polyhydroxy moieties on different polymeric molecules . other crosslinking agents useful in the gels of the present invention include salts , such as ferric chloride , calcium chloride and the acetates of the multivalent cations of lead , chromium or nickel . those skilled in the art will recognize that by careful manipulation of reaction conditions , e . g ., temperature , ph , agitation , time of reaction , etc ., a degree of crosslinking can be achieved in the gel without the use of these crosslinking agents . such crosslinking can be detected by viscosity changes or by gel formations . however , the difficulty in preparing a stable medically - acceptable gel makes the above means of crosslinking less desirable than the borate - guar system . the preferred embodiment of the present invention includes within the crosslinked gum , any salt suitable to act as a conductor for the passage of electric current from an electrode to the body of a patient . however , crosslinked gums containing no salt are also contemplated since the gels of the present invention are aqueous in major portions and can conduct a current when subjected to high voltages . the preferred salts are chlorides , particularly those of sodium or potassium , since these are the most compatible with the normal electrolytes within the body . the chlorides are particularly preferred for use with the very sensitive ag / agcl ( silver / silver chloride ) electrodes , as they take part in the cell reaction and contribute to the proper functioning of the electrode . as previously mentioned the ag / agcl electrodes are particularly well suited for measuring minute electrical bio - events . the electrolyte concentration is important as it affects both current carrying capacity and skin irritation . for monitoring purposes , where electrodes may be worn for days at a time , it is desirable to keep the salt concentration below about 3 %. higher salt concentrations become irritating to the skin when in contact for prolonged periods and may cause serious lesions in the most severe cases . for short - term use as in cardiac stress testing , electrotherapy or electrosurgery , where the total contact time may be less than one hour , much higher salt concentrations can be used . the low electrical resistance necessary for the above - mentioned uses can only be exhibited by gels with high concentrations of electrolyte . a surprising feature of the crosslinked gels of the present invention are their stability even in the presence of saturated sodium chloride , approximately 25 percent by weight . thus , the present invention provides a gel which is stable in the presence of essentially any salt concentration desired . electrode storage time is another factor in the determination of electrolyte type and concentration . lower salt concentrations are preferred when electrodes are to be stored a long time between manufacture and use . salt solutions of sodium chloride and potassium chloride are corrosive to ferrous metals , with the result that gels high in concentrations of these salts may corrode the electrodes when in contact with the electrodes over a sufficiently long period of time . where storage periods are long and higher salt concentrations are desired , salts less corrosive than sodium chloride or potassium chloride , such as sodium citrate , should be used . the choice of electrolyte is also affected by electrode composition . where electrodes made of aluminum , stainless steel or german silver ( a silver - white alloy of copper , zinc and nickel ) are employed for biomonitoring purposes spurious signals or electrical noise are commonly experienced . such signals are thought to be generated by chemical reactions taking place between the electrode and corrosive conductive salts , such as sodium chloride . potassium citrate can be substituted for more corrosive salts , in order to reduce electrical noise . another aspect of the present invention may include the presence of humectants , plasticizers , and wetting agents in the crosslinked gel . humectants increase the ability of the gel to resist drying out when exposed to the atmosphere or to conditions of low humidity . plasticizers add smoothness and increased pliability to the gel . wetting agents permit the gel powder to disperse in water in a homogeneous and lump - free manner . 1 , 3 - butylene glycol , tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and dipropylene glycol are known plasticizers and humectants . diethylene glycol and glycerol have been commonly utilized as humectants . however , glycerol competes with guar gum for borate , and can interfere with proper gel formation by inhibiting crosslinking if present in sufficient quantity . propylene glycol can function in the gels of the present invention as a humectant , a plasticizer and a wetting agent for guar gum powder during manufacture . the gels of the present invention may also contain preservatives to prevent bacterial growth during storage and use . the parabens , e . g ., methyl and propyl - p - hydroxy - benzoates , are well - accepted preservatives for use in medicinal preparations . preferred components and concentrations for the gels of the present invention follow . all percentages are given in percents by weight . ______________________________________component percent by weight______________________________________guar gum ( sold by the stein hall 1 to 5 % co . under the trademarkjaguar ® hp -

mentioned uses can only be exhibited by gels with high concentrations of electrolyte . a surprising feature of the crosslinked gels of the present invention are their stability even in the presence of saturated sodium chloride , approximately 25 percent by weight . thus , the present invention provides a gel which is stable in the presence of essentially any salt concentration desired . electrode storage time is another factor in the determination of electrolyte type and concentration . lower salt concentrations are preferred when electrodes are to be stored a long time between manufacture and use . salt solutions of sodium chloride and potassium chloride are corrosive to ferrous metals , with the result that gels high in concentrations of these salts may corrode the electrodes when in contact with the electrodes over a sufficiently long period of time . where storage periods are long and higher salt concentrations are desired , salts less corrosive than sodium chloride or potassium chloride , such as sodium citrate , should be used . the choice of electrolyte is also affected by electrode composition . where electrodes made of aluminum , stainless steel or german silver ( a silver - white alloy of copper , zinc and nickel ) are employed for biomonitoring purposes spurious signals or electrical noise are commonly experienced . such signals are thought to be generated by chemical reactions taking place between the electrode and corrosive conductive salts , such as sodium chloride . potassium citrate can be substituted for more corrosive salts , in order to reduce electrical noise . another aspect of the present invention may include the presence of humectants , plasticizers , and wetting agents in the crosslinked gel . humectants increase the ability of the gel to resist drying out when exposed to the atmosphere or to conditions of low humidity . plasticizers add smoothness and increased pliability to the gel . wetting agents permit the gel powder to disperse in water in a homogeneous and lump - free manner . 1 , 3 - butylene glycol , tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol and dipropylene glycol are known plasticizers and humectants . diethylene glycol and glycerol have been commonly utilized as humectants . however , glycerol competes with guar gum for borate , and can interfere with proper gel formation by inhibiting crosslinking if present in sufficient quantity . propylene glycol can function in the gels of the present invention as a humectant , a plasticizer and a wetting agent for guar gum powder during manufacture . the gels of the present invention may also contain preservatives to prevent bacterial growth during storage and use . the parabens , e . g ., methyl and propyl - p - hydroxy - benzoates , are well - accepted preservatives for use in medicinal preparations . preferred components and concentrations for the gels of the present invention follow . all percentages are given in percents by weight . ______________________________________component percent by weight______________________________________guar gum ( sold by the stein hall 1 to 5 % co . under the trademarkjaguar ® hp -

{"description": "with reference now to the drawings and in particular to fig1 a log rolling apparatus incorporating the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be discussed in detail . specifically , fig1 shows the log rolling apparatus 10 as including a body member 12 having a topmost curved surface 14 extending over a substantial portion of the body member , and further including a depression or well 16 formed therein as an integral part thereof . further illustrated is the use of a sheet of canvas 18 , or other flexible material , which is comformingly positioned in an overlying relationship across the body member 12 including the topmost curved surface 14 and the well 16 . in this respect , the canvas 18 is fixedly secured to opposed ends 20 , 22 of the body member 12 through the use of respective attachment means 24 , 26 . the attachment means 24 , 26 are of a conventional construction and are designed to operate in a manner which permits the canvas sheet 18 to be adjusted in length , whereby the amount of canvas overlying the body member 12 can be controlled as desired . viewing fig1 and 2 together , it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus 10 further includes a rotation member 28 which is formed from a pair of first pivot arms 30 , 32 pivotally attached to opposed sides 34 , 36 , respectively , of the body member 12 and second pivot arms 38 , 40 respectively pivotally attached to the pivot arms 30 , 32 . additionally , the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are connected together through the use of a handle member 42 in the manner illustrated in fig2 . in this connection , it can be seen that the first pivot arms 30 , 32 respectively pivot about pivot points 44 , 46 , while the second pivot arms 38 , 40 are respectively pivotally attached to the first pivot arms at pivot points 48 , 50 . as is further evident with reference to fig1 - 3 , the rotation member 28 also includes a roller 52 which is normally positionable on a flat support surface 54 formed as a part of the body member 12 and which is rotatably attached between the second pivot arms 38 , 40 in the manner most clearly illustrated in fig2 . in this connection , the roller 52 is rotatably positioned on a roller shaft 56 fixedly secured to the second pivot arms 38 , 40 , while spring 57 is provided which is attached between the body member 12 and the pivotable arm 30 so as to facilitate a return of the rotation member 28 to the position shown in fig1 . as can be further ascertained with reference to fig1 - 3 , the roller 52 is positioned on the log rolling apparatus 10 in a manner whereby it lies between the canvas 18 fixedly secured to the body member 12 and the uppermost surface of the body member 12 per se , to include the topmost curved surface 14 as well as the surface associated with the well 16 . also , clearly shown in fig2 and 3 is the fact that the canvas 18 extends substantially across the entire transverse width of the body member 12 so as to essentially entirely cover the roller 52 , the well 16 and the topmost curved surface 14 . fig4 has been provided to illustrate a second slightly modified embodiment of the present invention which differs only in the structural form of the body member 58 . in this respect , the body member 58 functions in the same manner as the body member 12 illustrated in the embodiment of fig1 with the exception that the topmost curved surface 14 of the fig1 embodiment has been replaced by a topmost flat surface 60 . to support this configuration , the well 62 has a first side portion 64 which is of a substantially greater length than a second side portion 66 associated with the other side of the well . this construction differs to some degree from the construction of fig1 and accordingly , the embodiment of fig4 can be operated by a user with somewhat less movement than that required by the first embodiment above described . as can be appreciated , the other elements associated with the log rolling apparatus 10 illustrated in fig4 are essentially the same as those disclosed in the embodiment of fig1 including a roller 52 positioned on a flat surface 54 and located between a canvas 18 fixedly secured to respective ends 20 , 22 of the body member 58 . further , a rotation member 28 is provided which includes the use of the same first pivot arms 30 , 32 , as well as second pivot arms 38 , 40 . as such , the embodiments of fig1 and 4 are closely related in structure and are functionally operable in the exact same manner . with respect to the operation of the present invention and with reference to fig1 it can be seen that the log rolling apparatus should initially be provided with the rotation member 28 in the position illustrated , wherein the roller 52 is resting between the canvas 18 and the flat support surface 54 . a user may then position a sheet of material 68 , which typically might consist of a sheet of newspaper or the like , in the manner illustrated whereby the sheet 68 partially extends into the well portion 16 , as well as overlying a portion of the topmost curved surface 14 . as desired then , any type of flammable material 70 may be positioned in the well 16 so that the same fills a substantial portion of the well and partially overlies the sheet 68 . at this point of the operation then , a user need only to grip the rotation member 28 , preferably by the handle 42 , and then rotate the same about the pivot point 44 in the manner indicated in phantom lines in fig1 . specifically , it can be seen that a movement of the rotation member 28 to a first intermediate position 72 , as shown in phantom lines , results in a rolling up of the sheet of material 68 due to the cross surface translational movement of the canvas 18 caused by the securing of the canvas to the body member 12 through use of attachment means 24 . at this point , it can be appreciated that the roller 52 facilitates the movement of the rotation member 28 in the manner described since canvas portion 74 , also indicated in phantom lines , increases in length during the rotational movement of the member 28 , such increase in length being afforded by the canvas slidably rolling across the roller 52 . as such , the canvas portions 76 and 78 lying proximate to the sheet material 68 move in opposite directions relative to one another so as to afford a rolling effect on the sheet . as can be further appreciated with reference to fig1 the rolling of the sheet 68 into a cylindrical shape results in the flammable material 70 becoming permanently captured therein whereby a log 80 is created which is suitable for burning in a fireplace or the like . by the same token , it should noted that the multi - link construction of the arms of the rotation member 28 permits the distance between the shaft 56 , which is the axis of rotation of the roller 52 , and the arm pivot points 44 , 46 to vary so as to accommodate the rolling movement of the roller over the surface 14 of the body member 12 . in this respect , the multi - link construction permits the arm lengths to vary so that it is not necessary to construct the body member surface 14 in a perfectly circular shape , which would otherwise be required if the arm lengths were not variable . once the rotation member 28 as been rotated about the pivot point 44 to the position 82 , also illustrated in phantom lines , it can be seen that the rolling operation has been completed so that the log 80 may be removed from the log rolling apparatus 10 . the return spring 57 will then operate to assist the user in returning the rotation member 28 to the &# 34 ; at rest &# 34 ; position shown in fig1 whereby a new sheet of material 68 may be inserted in the well 16 preparatory to making another log 80 . of course , the embodiment of fig4 operates in essentially the same manner as that above described with reference to the embodiment of fig1 . in this regard , it can be seen that a rotation of the member 28 about the embodiment of fig4 will create a similar log 80 once the member has been moved to the phantom position 84 , and a continued rotation thereof will result in the log being positioned ready for removal on the topmost flat surface 60 . with respect to the above embodiments described , it can be understood that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art , and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the invention , subject only to limitations specifically appearing in the claims . in this connection , the types of materials as well as the structural configurations of the parts may take many different forms . for example , the present invention could be utilized to roll exclusively sheets of material into logs , such as logs which are constructed entirely of newspaper , while the flammable material 70 positionable within sheets 68 of newspapers or the like , might be wood chips , corn fodder , leaves , etc . further , it can be appreciated that the sheets 68 might be formed from materials other than newspapers , such as cloth , plastics , etc . the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention . further , since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art , it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described , and accordingly , all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to , falling within the scope of the invention .", "abstract": "a log rolling apparatus includes a body having a depression or well positioned therein and a large sheet of canvas or similar flexible material positioned over the body and the well . the canvas is fixedly attached to respective ends of the body and a dual link pivotal member is provided to which is attached a roller movable between the body and the canvas . sheets of flammable material and optionally other burnable material , such as leaves or the like , may be placed within the well over the top surface of the canvas , and the pivotal member may then be rotated about the body in a manner which causes the canvas to attempt to follow the roller attached to the member , thus causing the top surface of the canvas to slide against itself so as to roll up the flammable sheet material into a log shape with the leaves , if used , enclosed by the sheet material .", "generate_prompt": "You must respond based strictly on the information in a provided passage.

or they may be discontinuous , such as one made of strips of material to form a loose mesh - like structure . “ pets ” refers generally to a domesticated or tamed animal kept for companionship or pleasure and treated with care and affection . dogs and cats are the most common , but certainly not the only , types of “ pets ” amenable to this invention . primates , pigs , goats , sheep , birds , lemurs , ferrets and other types of animals have also been reported as pets , and this list is still not exhaustive . although the description may refer to the more typical pets , it will be understood that the invention is broadly applicable to any animal , domesticated or not , that has a head and mouth . “ handlers ” refers to anyone who is responsible for moving , transporting , or manipulating the pet in any way . this explicitly includes owners and family members of owners ; caregivers such as veterinarians , veterinary dentists , groomers , trainers , instructors , kennel operators , zoo personnel , etc . ; and implicitly includes any other party meeting the general definition . referring to fig3 , the head or nose of an animal is referred to anatomically as the anterior end and the tail is referred to as the posterior ( sometimes caudal ) end . in organisms , that have distinct heads ( such as cats , dogs , birds , primates , and most other vertebrates ) the anterior end is sometimes referred to as the rostral or cranial end . while “ anterior ”/“ posterior ” has broader applicability for all animals , applicant prefers rostral ( for nose or beak ) and caudal ( tail ) as directional terms . this is consistent with nomina anatomica veterinaria , and with common usage in veterinary medicine . moreover , given that the invention relates to headgear , cranial might be confusing . of course , dorsal / ventral , medial / lateral , proximate / distal and other anatomical terms may also be used in the description . unless defined otherwise , all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention belongs . although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention , the preferred methods and materials are described herein . all references cited herein , including books , journal articles , published u . s . or foreign patent applications , issued u . s . or foreign patents , and any other references , are each incorporated by reference in their entireties , including all data , tables , figures , and text presented in the cited references . numerical ranges , measurements and parameters used to characterize the invention — for example , angular degrees , quantities of ingredients , polymer molecular weights , reaction conditions ( ph , temperatures , charge levels , etc . ), physical dimensions and so forth — are necessarily approximations ; and , while reported as precisely as possible , they inherently contain imprecision derived from their respective measurements . consequently , all numbers expressing ranges of magnitudes as used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “ about .” all numerical ranges are understood to include all possible incremental sub - ranges within the outer boundaries of the range . thus , a range of 30 to 90 units discloses , for example , 35 to 50 units , 45 to 85 units , and 40 to 80 units , etc . unless otherwise defined , percentages are wt / wt %. referring first to fig1 a - 1c and fig4 , one embodiment of the headgear 10 is illustrated showing the “ clamshell ” nature of the head gear 10 , having two portions 10 a and 10 b , joined at a hinge area 12 . throughout this description a reference numeral , ( e . g . 6 ) may have a suffix “ a ” ( e . g . 6 a ) for a right - side part , and a suffix “ b ” ( e . g . 6 b ) for a corresponding or complementary left - side part , relative to the animal . fig1 a shows only the right half portion 10 a in top and bottom views ; while fig1 b shows only the right half portion 10 a in rostral ( front ) and caudal ( rear ) views . each of the half portions 10 a and 10 b define a periphery 11 a , 11 b that is complementary to periphery of the other side , and are cup - like or arcuate defining a cavity 13 for enclosing a spherical - like head . at a caudal area 19 of the periphery 11 ( near the hinge area 12 in this embodiment ), each of the half portions 10 a and 10 b also define semicircular recesses 14 a and 14 b that together form a generally circular opening to accommodate the neck of the animal . at the apex of a rostral end 21 , there may be one or more openings 17 to admit air and or light to the interior cavity 13 . the embodiment of the headgear 10 illustrated in fig1 a to 1c may be solid , but preferably transparent . near the rostral end 21 of the clamshell headgear 10 is a fastening mechanism such as latch 16 , which typically comprises a first portion 16 a on half 10 a , and a complementary portion 16 b located on half 10 b . the fastening mechanism may comprise one or more latches that hold the headgear closed securely about the head . generally at least one latch is in a rostral area opposing the hinge area . as shown in fig1 e to 1g in particular , the latch 16 is generally opposite from the hinge 12 . alternative locations for fastening mechanisms that may still oppose the hinge area include the ventral neck area below the jaw and / or forehead area near the eyes . other fastening mechanisms are described below . a pleasant sensory zone ( psz ) 40 may optionally be incorporated at or near the rostral end 21 of the headgear 10 . these also are described below . also shown in this embodiment in fig4 is a ring 18 or other attachment point for a leash . the ring 18 may appear on one or both halves 10 a , 10 b of the clamshell headgear 10 . referring now to fig1 d to 1g , an embodiment is illustrated wherein the device may be solid and not transparent , but includes orifices 20 a , 20 b for ears , orifices 22 a , 22 b for eyes , and orifice 17 or slots 24 a , 24 b for mouth / nose or other ventilation . in this way the pet can see externally . in other variations , the slots may also be replaced with a single extended opening ( as shown in fig5 a ) so that the handler can better see into the pet &# 39 ; s mouth . the ear orifices 20 also permit the headgear 10 to be smaller and lighter and fit closely to the head of the animal for a more secure , tighter fit . especially in closely - fitted headgear , it may be desirable to provide cushioning or padding 26 a , 26 b in areas of the device that might rub on parts of the animal &# 39 ; s head , causing irritation . headgear that closely fits the head will have skull - following contours either molded into the device or as a result of selective padding in the interior of the headgear . a second embodiment is illustrated in fig2 a to 2c . in this embodiment , the headgear 30 is composed of two halves 30 a , 30 b fabricated as a loose mesh material of criss - crossing bands that also allow for visibility and breathing . higher strength , thicker sagittal bands 52 a and 52 b form the periphery of each clamshell half along a mid - sagittal plane . similar wider or reinforced coronal bands 52 a , and 54 b may be used in a coronal plane to provide a more rigid clamshell shape . the remainder of the headgear 30 is formed of either solid material like front wall 60 , or the intermediate bands 56 that form a loose mesh or a combination of these . the headgear 30 includes a hinge area 32 , typically at a caudal end 39 opposing the rostral end 41 , and semicircular recesses 34 a , 34 b that form the neck opening . in some embodiments , headgear 30 may include fenestrations , openings , or orifices 41 a , 41 b for ears , orifices 42 a , 42 b for eyes , and orifices for mouth as well ( not shown in fig2 a - 2c ). however , unless otherwise indicated , both the solid headgear 10 and the mesh or open headgear 30 may have similar features and advantages and will be described together . the clamshell half portions may be sized in various dimensions to define a cavity 13 and orifices that accommodate the varied nose size and head shapes of pets of different genus , species , or breeds . for example a large size cup is required to encase breeds such as great danes , newfoundlands or st . bernards ; while much smaller cup portions are required for smaller breeds such as chihuahuas , shih - tzus , and many ‘ miniature ’ breeds . a special version may be devised for pugs , as they have almost no rostral protrusion . similarly , cats and pets of other species will require headgear halves proportioned for their respective noses . fig5 - 6 further illustrate embodiments for different species . referring to fig1 and 4 , the clamshell headgear comprises two half - shell portions that are hinged or fastened together . the hinge area 32 may be reinforced with thicker or wider sections as best shown in fig2 a and 2b . the hinge may comprise a “ living ” hinge as is well known in the injection molding arts , and the halves can easily be molded as one unit . alternatively the hinge may be fabric , as shown in fig1 g , or other material . in some embodiments , the hinge may be located rostrally . these embodiments are generally positioned on the pet &# 39 ; s head from and anterior perspective . embodiments that have a hinge along a top or superior aspect of the head gear are generally put on from a superior approach ; embodiments that have a hinge along a lower or inferior aspect of the head gear are generally put on from below , using an inferior approach ; and embodiments that have a hinge along a lateral aspect of the head gear would be put on using a right or left lateral approach . in a more preferred variation , the hinge is located at a caudal part of the headgear , allowing an approach posteriorly . as noted , this is advantageous in that the pet will not see the device approaching and will not enter the anxiety and resistance modes so quickly . at the aspect of the clamshell headgear opposing the hinge is a fastener or latch mechanism . the fastener or latch may comprise any type of device suited for securing the two clamshell halves together about the pet &# 39 ; s head . illustrative types of fasteners include buckles ( e . g . quick release , side release , and conventional ), snaps , hook - and - loop fasteners ( such as velcro ™ brand ), resilient clips or tabs with detents that may insert under opposing clips , tabs or slots , or other securing mechanism may be used to secure the two halves together . as best shown in fig2 c near the rostral end 41 , the sagittal band area may be reinforced with thicker or wider band sections or a solid portion to accommodate a fastening mechanism . alternatively , the latch may be located at a rostral end or simply at the ventral side of the neck , relying on the size of the neck relative to the base of the skull to secure the device . while right and left halves that part along a sagittal plane are depicted in fig1 and 2 , it will be understood that the halves may also part along a transverse plane , producing top and bottom halves instead of right and left halves . in the case of transverse plane top and bottom halves , the hinge and fastener are located on opposite lateral sides of the headgear , and the headgear is brought near to the animal &# 39 ; s head from the side containing the hinge . fig5 a and 5b show an alternative embodiments of the headgear 110 , 210 in a closed position about the head h of an animal such as a cat . the hinge area 112 lies at a caudal position . in the embodiment of fig5 a , and there are openings 120 , 122 and 124 to allow access to the animal &# 39 ; s ears , eyes and nose / mouth , respectively . these openings allow a handler access for examining , treating , feeding , dosing medication or other necessary activity associated with the ears , eyes and nose / mouth of the animal . recess 14 a is shown for the animal &# 39 ; s neck . in phantom , a variation is shown having an elongated neck or collar portion 128 if there is a need or desire to restrict flexion of the neck . latch 116 is shown along the ventral side of the neck , although it could alternatively be anywhere under the chin area up to the rostral tip . a psz 40 for taste or smell sensations may be located between the eye opening 120 and the nose / mouth opening 124 at the rostral end . the openings 122 , 124 over the eyes and nose / mouth may be completely open , or they may have solid inserts ( not shown ) with air perforations for breathing and / or made of transparent material for sight , or opaque material if the animal tends to be calmed by less visual stimulation . in the embodiment of fig5 b , the headgear 210 is of a mesh construction similar to the embodiment of fig2 a - 2c , and having recesses 234 to define a neck opening , a fastening latch mechanism 216 , and web or band members such as 256 . a psz may or may not be present . although the animal shown in fig5 a and 5b is a cat , this same type of headgear could also be used on a dog or other animal , with only minimal modifications to size the headgear to closely fit the animals head ; for example elongating the headgear in a caudal - rostral dimension for a dog having a longer jaw and nose area , or adjusting the locations of ear and / or eye openings to be suitable for the dog or other animal . fig6 illustrates another embodiment of the headgear 310 in a closed position about the head h of a dog . the halves of the clamshell are again hinged at a caudal location 312 . the neck or collar portion 328 is shown in a moderately extended position , but may extend even further if desired to minimize or prevent neck flexion as shown in phantom . there is little coronal aspect to this embodiment . the head and eyes are relatively free . however , there is a rostral portion 330 that is fairly lengthened in order to prevent bites . latch 316 and leash attachment 318 are also shown in this embodiment . in some embodiments , the headgear device can act as a base for attachment of novelty headgear such as reindeer ears , bunny ears , baseball caps , sun shades , rain gear , etc . it can also act as an attachment point for halloween type masks and costumes . in some cases , the headgear , with or without other attachments can help promote wound healing by restricting the animal &# 39 ; s ability to lick or bite at the wounded area . in this sense , it can act like the well - known “ elizabethan collar ” restraints but is infinitely more comfortable and tolerable than the traditional cone of shame collars in present use . in use , the headgear is easily placed about the pet &# 39 ; s head and secured . in psz embodiments , the psz may be preloaded with an appropriate stimulus for the particular pet as discussed above . alternatively , the headgear may be fitted first , and the stimulus is loaded into the headgear in situ . the location of the hinge generally dictates the direction of approach to the pet . since the fastener is on an opposite side as the hinge , the clamshell opening is with the latch and that side must be brought towards the pet first . this is why the caudal hinge location is a preferred embodiment — it allows the handler to fit the headgear posteriorly , from behind the pet . the handler then biases or presses the clamshell halves closed about the head . for sagittal plane ( right and left halves ) the bias is towards a medial direction to the mid - sagittal plane ; while for coronal plane embodiments , the bias is from a ventral and dorsal extreme toward the midline . the biasing force is easily delivered by the handler &# 39 ; s hands . another advantage of the caudal hinge embodiment is that the hands and arms of the handler doing the biasing remain behind the animal , relatively safe from bites or scratches . once closed , the fastener of the headgear is secured , clamping the two halves together . the device allows restraint for such procedures as examination , venipuncture , pedicures , bathing , and grooming . in other uses , the device is useful for socializing and training an animal . in some situations , and aggressor animal may need to be restrained to prevent it from harming another anima . thus the invention includes a method to mitigate injury from interspecific and intraspecific interactions such as aggression between two dogs or two cats , or a cat and a dog . this can allow training and socialization in situations in which the aggressor could not be trusted with the non aggressor , or to prevent escalation of aggression between animals . a leading cause of death for dogs under the age of 3 is due to poor socialization which results in fear and associated aggression . a critical socialization period for dogs is between 3 weeks and 3 months of age . animals not well socialized during this time can become more fearful and aggressive when they encounter new dogs , new people , unfamiliar situations that interfere with appropriate socialization later . the headgear can protect people and other animals during these interactions so that the animal can learn appropriate behavior . it can also mitigate dangerous behavior and allow the animal to coexist . the clamshell headgear material will be lightweight , durable , and somewhat flexible . it will also need to be fairly strong and tactile so that the handler has no issues manipulating or maneuvering the animal . a couple of potential materials are mesh wire coated in plastic , or a synthetic plastic that would be injection molded . an animal will react negatively towards the headgear if it is any way uncomfortable for them , so , along with custom sizing , this design is made from a lightweight material so it is almost weightless for the animal wearing it . color : the color of this product can vary greatly . there will be different options for purchase such as a deluxe model and a standard model . in the deluxe model there could be any color produced and for the standard they may only be a few colors offered . not every animal will have the same size or shape of the head . the “ clamshell ” headgear will come in a variety of sizes and offer a superior fit than any other product on the market . this custom sizing ensures that the headgear will not be removed during use and will be comfortable for the animal . in some embodiments , inside of the headgear there is optionally another layer of security and comfort added . a soft wrap or padding may be employed in animals needing only limited restriction . by utilizing technology similar to that of an air cast one can reproduce a “ hug ” effect on the animal . this serves to reduce stress and calms the animal , making the restraint more acceptable , which is important for fractious animals and reduces the need for repeated sedations . the headgear preferably has openings for access to the ears , eyes , and the mouth . this is extremely important in veterinary and veterinary dental settings where the animal may need to have routine examinations and / or medicine applied to these areas . use of the device facilitates and aids in administration of oral treatments and medications ; dental treatment and medications ; ophthalmic treatments and medications ; and ear treatments and medications . grips : properly positioned grips are preferably built - in to the headgear to allow for safe manipulation of the animal &# 39 ; s head without risk of injury . this is especially important for medical treatment caregivers , when blood needs to be drawn from the animal . ear clamp : the implementation of an ear clamp will serve two main purposes . the first is to secure the ear during procedures and examinations , and the second is to get a pulse rate from the animal to know when dangerous levels are being approached . this is added security for the handler and the patient . plastic cover : a plastic cover or “ overshell ” that goes around the “ clamshell ” headgear will be developed as well so once the headgear is applied , the animal can be isolated within it . this case can serve as an oxygen mask and also a way of anesthetizing the patient . oral speculum : an oral speculum is another feature that could be added to the headgear . this speculum would hold the mouth open during examinations and procedures reducing the risk of a bite . fixation and venipuncture : a feature of the headgear is that it allows the head and neck area to be immobilized , particularly if the neck collar extension 128 is employed . this may be useful in treating neck injuries . in addition , with or without the collar extension , a jugular venipuncture is more easily accomplished to draw blood samples if the head and neck are immobilized through use of the headgear device . sensors & amp ; indicators : the headgear may be fitted with sensors and indicators that provide useful information about the animal &# 39 ; s biological or physiologic status . it may include lights that vary in color or number ( e . g . red , yellow , green ) to indicate dangerous or safe conditions . such sensors may also be useful in a positive reinforcement feedback loop that operates to release the pleasant stimulus in response to sensors that detect a calm and relaxed physiologic state , so as to reinforce this desired behavior . this feature is particularly useful for training purposes . as noted above , a key aspect of the invention is the pleasant sensory zone ( psz ) or module that is designed specially to appease the pet and reduce the anxiety and stress caused by strange handlers , strange environments , and foreign smells sounds and sights , and strange , unusual and sometimes uncomfortable manipulations or procedures . the psz is designed to pleasurably stimulate any of the pet &# 39 ; s senses , specifically one or more of the senses of : vision / sight , olfactory / smell , auditory / sound , taste , and tactile / touch . the psz may be incorporated as a module or portion of the headgear that facilitates the delivery of a pleasant sensory stimulus to the proper area of the pet receptors for receiving that stimulus . for example , as discussed below , pheromones or flavors might be includes in a psz near the pet &# 39 ; s nostrils at a rostral end of the headgear . similarly , a tactile psz might be included along a portion of the headgear adjacent a ventral neck or chin area or a dorsal nape of the neck area ; while an auditory stimulus would be included near the ear ( s ). a flavor port located at a rostral portion near the mouth would provide a host of benefits for the handler . this allows for easy distraction of the animal during procedures , helps habituate them to the headgear through positive reinforcement , and reduces stress . for dogs , this might include peanut butter , bacon or other treat . for cats , tuna , catnip or chicken might be preferred . this port may stimulate gustatory receptors , olfactory receptors , or both . a specific embodiment of a flavor port type of psz 40 is illustrated in cross - section in fig2 d . in the clamshell portion near the rostral aspect , the wall 60 forms an opening 62 through which a wafer or disk 64 of candy or other treat may be exposed and smelled or licked by the animal . extension wall 66 extends outwardly and around the disk or wafer 64 to form a pocket between the wall 60 and extension wall 66 . at one end or top of the pocket an extension wall may be eliminated to allow the handler to slide the wafer or disk 66 into the pocket from outside the headgear to provide the stimulus for the animal . flanges 68 of wall 60 extend beyond the limit of extension walls 66 to hold the wafer or disk 64 in the pocket so it cannot immediately be eaten by the animal . an alternative flavor port takes the form of a treat dispenser that , upon activation , dispenses a candy or other treat though an opening into the cavity 13 for the animal to eat . the pez candy dispenser loaded with animal treats is a suitable mechanism that could be used in for this type of flavor port . to help make the headgear more attractive for the animal the use of pheromones could be applied as an olfactory stimulus . by infusing the headgear with specific pheromones in a psz area near the nostrils , it will reduce the stress levels for the animal , and have a calming effect . the pet may actually learn to enjoy wearing the device , and it may in turn be used more frequently and with ease . olfactory stimuli such as pheromones could be delivered using a pocket - like structure described above having a scent infused wafer , but having a perforated barrier in wall 60 rather than a complete opening . this would allow the scent to permeate the perforated barrier while preventing the animal from eating the wafer . pleasing sounds , such as “ white noise ” generators may have a calming effect . obviously , these pszs would be located near an ear area of the headgear . miniature speakers driven by onboard integrated chips and battery power could provide this stimulus . music might be stored in the chip or preferably communicated to the chip wirelessly from a phone or tablet or computer by using , for example , bluetooth technology and paring the devices . a tactile sensation may be provided by means of finger - like protrusions that “ scratch ” the pet in key places like under the chin or the neck . another tactile stimuli might be bumps or ridges that apply pressure to key points on the animal . such pressure points may include the carotid body to perform a vagal maneuver to slow the heart rate and calm the animal . other useful pressure points are known to those versed in acupressure techniques . in some animals , it is calming to “ blind ” them visual stimuli . in such cases , an opaque cover over an eye opening may have a pleasant and calming effect as a psz . the foregoing description of the various aspects and embodiments of the present invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description . it is not intended to be exhaustive of all embodiments or to limit the invention to the specific aspects disclosed . obvious modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings and such modifications and variations may well fall within the scope of the invention as determined by the appended claims when interpreted in accordance with the breadth to which they are fairly , legally and equitably entitled .", "abstract": "a pet headgear comprises two halves operable in “ clamshell ” fashion to surround the head , nose and mouth of a pet , to facilitate handling of the pet in familiar or especially unfamiliar environments , such as veterinary offices , groomers , kennels or during transporting . the clamshell hinges at one end , preferably a caudal end , so it may be applied from behind the pet and the two halves biased medially to close the shell about the pet &# 39 ;

while fig1 b shows only the right half portion 10 a in rostral ( front ) and caudal ( rear ) views . each of the half portions 10 a and 10 b define a periphery 11 a , 11 b that is complementary to periphery of the other side , and are cup - like or arcuate defining a cavity 13 for enclosing a spherical - like head . at a caudal area 19 of the periphery 11 ( near the hinge area 12 in this embodiment ), each of the half portions 10 a and 10 b also define semicircular recesses 14 a and 14 b that together form a generally circular opening to accommodate the neck of the animal . at the apex of a rostral end 21 , there may be one or more openings 17 to admit air and or light to the interior cavity 13 . the embodiment of the headgear 10 illustrated in fig1 a to 1c may be solid , but preferably transparent . near the rostral end 21 of the clamshell headgear 10 is a fastening mechanism such as latch 16 , which typically comprises a first portion 16 a on half 10 a , and a complementary portion 16 b located on half 10 b . the fastening mechanism may comprise one or more latches that hold the headgear closed securely about the head . generally at least one latch is in a rostral area opposing the hinge area . as shown in fig1 e to 1g in particular , the latch 16 is generally opposite from the hinge 12 . alternative locations for fastening mechanisms that may still oppose the hinge area include the ventral neck area below the jaw and / or forehead area near the eyes . other fastening mechanisms are described below . a pleasant sensory zone ( psz ) 40 may optionally be incorporated at or near the rostral end 21 of the headgear 10 . these also are described below . also shown in this embodiment in fig4 is a ring 18 or other attachment point for a leash . the ring 18 may appear on one or both halves 10 a , 10 b of the clamshell headgear 10 . referring now to fig1 d to 1g , an embodiment is illustrated wherein the device may be solid and not transparent , but includes orifices 20 a , 20 b for ears , orifices 22 a , 22 b for eyes , and orifice 17 or slots 24 a , 24 b for mouth / nose or other ventilation . in this way the pet can see externally . in other variations , the slots may also be replaced with a single extended opening ( as shown in fig5 a ) so that the handler can better see into the pet &# 39 ; s mouth . the ear orifices 20 also permit the headgear 10 to be smaller and lighter and fit closely to the head of the animal for a more secure , tighter fit . especially in closely - fitted headgear , it may be desirable to provide cushioning or padding 26 a , 26 b in areas of the device that might rub on parts of the animal &# 39 ; s head , causing irritation . headgear that closely fits the head will have skull - following contours either molded into the device or as a result of selective padding in the interior of the headgear . a second embodiment is illustrated in fig2 a to 2c . in this embodiment , the headgear 30 is composed of two halves 30 a , 30 b fabricated as a loose mesh material of criss - crossing bands that also allow for visibility and breathing . higher strength , thicker sagittal bands 52 a and 52 b form the periphery of each clamshell half along a mid - sagittal plane . similar wider or reinforced coronal bands 52 a , and 54 b may be used in a coronal plane to provide a more rigid clamshell shape . the remainder of the headgear 30 is formed of either solid material like front wall 60 , or the intermediate bands 56 that form a loose mesh or a combination of these . the headgear 30 includes a hinge area 32 , typically at a caudal end 39 opposing the rostral end 41 , and semicircular recesses 34 a , 34 b that form the neck opening . in some embodiments , headgear 30 may include fenestrations , openings , or orifices 41 a , 41 b for ears , orifices 42 a , 42 b for eyes , and orifices for mouth as well ( not shown in fig2 a - 2c ). however , unless otherwise indicated , both the solid headgear 10 and the mesh or open headgear 30 may have similar features and advantages and will be described together . the clamshell half portions may be sized in various dimensions to define a cavity 13 and orifices that accommodate the varied nose size and head shapes of pets of different genus , species , or breeds . for example a large size cup is required to encase breeds such as great danes , newfoundlands or st . bernards ; while much smaller cup portions are required for smaller breeds such as chihuahuas , shih - tzus , and many ‘ miniature ’ breeds . a special version may be devised for pugs , as they have almost no rostral protrusion . similarly , cats and pets of other species will require headgear halves proportioned for their respective noses . fig5 - 6 further illustrate embodiments for different species . referring to fig1 and 4 , the clamshell headgear comprises two half - shell portions that are hinged or fastened together . the hinge area 32 may be reinforced with thicker or wider sections as best shown in fig2 a and 2b . the hinge may comprise a “ living ” hinge as is well known in the injection molding arts , and the halves can easily be molded as one unit . alternatively the hinge may be fabric , as shown in fig1 g , or other material . in some embodiments , the hinge may be located rostrally . these embodiments are generally positioned on the pet &# 39 ; s head from and anterior perspective . embodiments that have a hinge along a top or superior aspect of the head gear are generally put on from a superior approach ; embodiments that have a hinge along a lower or inferior aspect of the head gear are generally put on from below , using an inferior approach ; and embodiments that have a hinge along a lateral aspect of the head gear would be put on using a right or left lateral approach . in a more preferred variation , the hinge is located at a caudal part of the headgear , allowing an approach posteriorly . as noted , this is advantageous in that the pet will not see the device approaching and will not enter the anxiety and resistance modes so quickly . at the aspect of the clamshell headgear opposing the hinge is a fastener or latch mechanism . the fastener or latch may comprise any type of device suited for securing the two clamshell halves together about the pet &# 39 ; s head . illustrative types of fasteners include buckles ( e . g . quick release , side release , and conventional ), snaps , hook - and - loop fasteners ( such as velcro ™ brand ), resilient clips or tabs with detents that may insert under opposing clips , tabs or slots , or other securing mechanism may be used to secure the two halves together . as best shown in fig2 c near the rostral end 41 , the sagittal band area may be reinforced with thicker or wider band sections or a solid portion to accommodate a fastening mechanism . alternatively , the latch may be located at a rostral end or simply at the ventral side of the neck , relying on the size of the neck relative to the base of the skull to secure the device . while right and left halves that part along a sagittal plane are depicted in fig1 and 2 , it will be understood that the halves may also part along a transverse plane , producing top and bottom halves instead of right and left halves . in the case of transverse plane top and bottom halves , the hinge and fastener are located on opposite lateral sides of the headgear , and the headgear is brought near to the animal &# 39 ; s head from the side containing the hinge . fig5 a and 5b show an alternative embodiments of the headgear 110 , 210 in a closed position about the head h of an animal such as a cat . the hinge area 112 lies at a caudal position . in the embodiment of fig5 a , and there are openings 120 , 122 and 124 to allow access to the animal &# 39 ; s ears , eyes and nose / mouth , respectively . these openings allow a handler access for examining , treating , feeding , dosing medication or other necessary activity associated with the ears , eyes and nose / mouth of the animal . recess 14 a is shown for the animal &# 39 ; s neck . in phantom , a variation is shown having an elongated neck or collar portion 128 if there is a need or desire to restrict flexion of the neck . latch 116 is shown along the ventral side of the neck , although it could alternatively be anywhere under the chin area up to the rostral tip . a psz 40 for taste or smell sensations may be located between the eye opening 120 and the nose / mouth opening 124 at the rostral end . the openings 122 , 124 over the eyes and nose / mouth may be completely open , or they may have solid inserts ( not shown ) with air perforations for breathing and / or made of transparent material for sight , or opaque material if the animal tends to be calmed by less visual stimulation . in the embodiment of fig5 b , the headgear 210 is of a mesh construction similar to the embodiment of fig2 a - 2c , and having recesses 234 to define a neck opening , a fastening latch mechanism 216 , and web or band members such as 256 . a psz may or may not be present . although the animal shown in fig5 a and 5b is a cat , this same type of headgear could also be used on a dog or other animal , with only minimal modifications to size the headgear to closely fit the animals head ; for example elongating the headgear in a caudal - rostral dimension for a dog having a longer jaw and nose area , or adjusting the locations of ear and / or eye openings to be suitable for the dog or other animal . fig6 illustrates another embodiment of the headgear 310 in a closed position about the head h of a dog . the halves of the clamshell are again hinged at a caudal location 312 . the neck or collar portion 328 is shown in a moderately extended position , but may extend even further if desired to minimize or prevent neck flexion as shown in phantom . there is little coronal aspect to this embodiment . the head and eyes are relatively free . however , there is a rostral portion 330 that is fairly lengthened in order to prevent bites . latch 316 and leash attachment 318 are also shown in this embodiment . in some embodiments , the headgear device can act as a base for attachment of novelty headgear such as reindeer ears , bunny ears , baseball caps , sun shades , rain gear , etc . it can also act as an attachment point for halloween type masks and costumes . in some cases , the headgear , with or without other attachments can help promote wound healing by restricting the animal &# 39 ; s ability to lick or bite at the wounded area . in this sense , it can act like the well - known “ elizabethan collar ” restraints but is infinitely more comfortable and tolerable than the traditional cone of shame collars in present use . in use , the headgear is easily placed about the pet &# 39 ; s head and secured . in psz embodiments , the psz may be preloaded with an appropriate stimulus for the particular pet as discussed above . alternatively , the headgear may be fitted first , and the stimulus is loaded into the headgear in situ . the location of the hinge generally dictates the direction of approach to the pet . since the fastener is on an opposite side as the hinge , the clamshell opening is with the latch and that side must be brought towards the pet first . this is why the caudal hinge location is a preferred embodiment — it allows the handler to fit the headgear posteriorly , from behind the pet . the handler then biases or presses the clamshell halves closed about the head . for sagittal plane ( right and left halves ) the bias is towards a medial direction to the mid - sagittal plane ; while for coronal plane embodiments , the bias is from a ventral and dorsal extreme toward the midline . the biasing force is easily delivered by the handler &# 39 ; s hands . another advantage of the caudal hinge embodiment is that the hands and arms of the handler doing the biasing remain behind the animal , relatively safe from bites or scratches . once closed , the fastener of the headgear is secured , clamping the two halves together . the device allows restraint for such procedures as examination , venipuncture , pedicures , bathing , and grooming . in other uses , the device is useful for socializing and training an animal . in some situations , and aggressor animal may need to be restrained to prevent it from harming another anima . thus the invention includes a method to mitigate injury from interspecific and intraspecific interactions such as aggression between two dogs or two cats , or a cat and a dog . this can allow training and socialization in situations in which the aggressor could not be trusted with the non aggressor , or to prevent escalation of aggression between animals . a leading cause of death for dogs under the age of 3 is due to poor socialization which results in fear and associated aggression . a critical socialization period for dogs is between 3 weeks and 3 months of age . animals not well socialized during this time can become more fearful and aggressive when they encounter new dogs , new people , unfamiliar situations that interfere with appropriate socialization later . the headgear can protect people and other animals during these interactions so that the animal can learn appropriate behavior . it can also mitigate dangerous behavior and allow the animal to coexist . the clamshell headgear material will be lightweight , durable , and somewhat flexible . it will also need to be fairly strong and tactile so that the handler has no issues manipulating or maneuvering the animal . a couple of potential materials are mesh wire coated in plastic , or a synthetic plastic that would be injection molded . an animal will react negatively towards the headgear if it is any way uncomfortable for them , so , along with custom sizing , this design is made from a lightweight material so it is almost weightless for the animal wearing it . color : the color of this product can vary greatly . there will be different options for purchase such as a deluxe model and a standard model . in the deluxe model there could be any color produced and for the standard they may only be a few colors offered . not every animal will have the same size or shape of the head . the “ clamshell ” headgear will come in a variety of sizes and offer a superior fit than any other product on the market . this custom sizing ensures that the headgear will not be removed during use and will be comfortable for the animal . in some embodiments , inside of the headgear there is optionally another layer of security and comfort added . a soft wrap or padding may be employed in animals needing only limited restriction . by utilizing technology similar to that of an air cast one can reproduce a “ hug ” effect on the animal . this serves to reduce stress and calms the animal , making the restraint more acceptable , which is important for fractious animals and reduces the need for repeated sedations . the headgear preferably has openings for access to the ears , eyes , and the mouth . this is extremely important in veterinary and veterinary dental settings where the animal may need to have routine examinations and / or medicine applied to these areas . use of the device facilitates and aids in administration of oral treatments and medications ; dental treatment and medications ; ophthalmic treatments and medications ; and ear treatments and medications . grips : properly positioned grips are preferably built - in to the headgear to allow for safe manipulation of the animal &# 39 ; s head without risk of injury . this is especially important for medical treatment caregivers , when blood needs to be drawn from the animal . ear clamp : the implementation of an ear clamp will serve two main purposes . the first is to secure the ear during procedures and examinations , and the second is to get a pulse rate from the animal to know when dangerous levels are being approached . this is added security for the handler and the patient . plastic cover : a plastic cover or “ overshell ” that goes around the “ clamshell ” headgear will be developed as well so once the headgear is applied , the animal can be isolated within it . this case can serve as an oxygen mask and also a way of anesthetizing the patient . oral speculum : an oral speculum is another feature that could be added to the headgear . this speculum would hold the mouth open during examinations and procedures reducing the risk of a bite . fixation and venipuncture : a feature of the headgear is that it allows the head and neck area to be immobilized , particularly if the neck collar extension 128 is employed . this may be useful in treating neck injuries . in addition , with or without the collar extension , a jugular venipuncture is more easily accomplished to draw blood samples if the head and neck are immobilized through use of the headgear device . sensors & amp ; indicators : the headgear may be fitted with sensors and indicators that provide useful information about the animal &# 39 ; s biological or physiologic status . it may include lights that vary in color or number ( e . g . red , yellow , green ) to indicate dangerous or safe conditions . such sensors may also be useful in a positive reinforcement feedback loop that operates to release the pleasant stimulus in response to sensors that detect a calm and relaxed physiologic state , so as to reinforce this desired behavior . this feature is particularly useful for training purposes . as noted above , a key aspect of the invention is the pleasant sensory zone ( psz ) or module that is designed specially to appease the pet and reduce the anxiety and stress caused by strange handlers , strange environments , and foreign smells sounds and sights , and strange , unusual and sometimes uncomfortable manipulations or procedures . the psz is designed to pleasurably stimulate any of the pet &# 39 ; s senses , specifically one or more of the senses of : vision / sight , olfactory / smell , auditory / sound , taste , and tactile / touch . the psz may be incorporated as a module or portion of the headgear that facilitates the delivery of a pleasant sensory stimulus to the proper area of the pet receptors for receiving that stimulus . for example , as discussed below , pheromones or flavors might be includes in a psz near the pet &# 39 ; s nostrils at a rostral end of the headgear . similarly , a tactile psz might be included along a portion of the headgear adjacent a ventral neck or chin area or a dorsal nape of the neck area ; while an auditory stimulus would be included near the ear ( s ). a flavor port located at a rostral portion near the mouth would provide a host of benefits for the handler . this allows for easy distraction of the animal during procedures , helps habituate them to the headgear through positive reinforcement , and reduces stress . for dogs , this might include peanut butter , bacon or other treat . for cats , tuna , catnip or chicken might be preferred . this port may stimulate gustatory receptors , olfactory receptors , or both . a specific embodiment of a flavor port type of psz 40 is illustrated in cross - section in fig2 d . in the clamshell portion near the rostral aspect , the wall 60 forms an opening 62 through which a wafer or disk 64 of candy or other treat may be exposed and smelled or licked by the animal . extension wall 66 extends outwardly and around the disk or wafer 64 to form a pocket between the wall 60 and extension wall 66 . at one end or top of the pocket an extension wall may be eliminated to allow the handler to slide the wafer or disk 66 into the pocket from outside the headgear to provide the stimulus for the animal . flanges 68 of wall 60 extend beyond the limit of extension walls 66 to hold the wafer or disk 64 in the pocket so it cannot immediately be eaten by the animal . an alternative flavor port takes the form of a treat dispenser that , upon activation , dispenses a candy or other treat though an opening into the cavity 13 for the animal to eat . the pez candy dispenser loaded with animal treats is a suitable mechanism that could be used in for this type of flavor port . to help make the headgear more attractive for the animal the use of pheromones could be applied as an olfactory stimulus . by infusing the headgear with specific pheromones in a psz area near the nostrils , it will reduce the stress levels for the animal , and have a calming effect . the pet may actually learn to enjoy wearing the device , and it may in turn be used more frequently and with ease . olfactory stimuli such as pheromones could be delivered using a pocket - like structure described above having a scent infused wafer , but having a perforated barrier in wall 60 rather than a complete opening . this would allow the scent to permeate the perforated barrier while preventing the animal from eating the wafer . pleasing sounds , such as “ white noise ” generators may have a calming effect . obviously , these pszs would be located near an ear area of the headgear . miniature speakers driven by onboard integrated chips and battery power could provide this stimulus . music might be stored in the chip or preferably communicated to the chip wirelessly from a phone or tablet or computer by using , for example , bluetooth technology and paring the devices . a tactile sensation may be provided by means of finger - like protrusions that “ scratch ” the pet in key places like under the chin or the neck . another tactile stimuli might be bumps or ridges that apply pressure to key points on the animal . such pressure points may include the carotid body to perform a vagal maneuver to slow the heart rate and calm the animal . other useful pressure points are known to those versed in acupressure techniques . in some animals , it is calming to “ blind ” them visual stimuli . in such cases , an opaque cover over an eye opening may have a pleasant and calming effect as a psz . the foregoing description of the various aspects and embodiments of the present invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description . it is not intended to be exhaustive of all embodiments or to limit the invention to the specific aspects disclosed . obvious modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings and such modifications and variations may well fall within the scope of the invention as determined by the appended claims when interpreted in accordance with the breadth to which they are fairly , legally and equitably entitled .\"."}

{"description": "jm216 is a platinum antitumor complex having poor water - solubility . this low solubility may be associated with bioavailability problems seen in a recent phase i clinical study where the compound was orally administered in the form of hard gelatin capsules with excipients ( microcrystalline cellulose , sodium starch glycolate , lactose anhydrous and magnesium stearate ). it was an object of the present invention to find a way of increasing the aqueous solubility of jm216 so as to improve the bioavailability of the compound and perhaps also eliminate or reduce side effects seen with oral dosing such as nausea and vomitting . it was another object of the invention to develop a suppository dosage formulation of jm216 which could provide the same therapeutic advantages of the existing oral formulation while also improving the bioavailability . it was hoped that the suppository formulation would also have an improved side - effect profile as well as being an alternate dosage form for those patients who cannot tolerate oral dosing , e . g . infant patients or patients with disorders of the digestive organs . the present inventors first attempted to reduce the particle size of the jm216 powder obtained from chemical synthesis by grinding or milling it to an amorphous state ( as confirmed by x - ray diffraction pattern ). the amorphous state indicates the disappearance of particles or crystalline drug and a particle size close to the molecular level . however , it was found to be very difficult to obtain an amorphous state by simply grinding the drug alone owing to the re - aggregation of drug powder by electrostatic force during the grinding process . the addition of β - cyclodextrin or polymers to the jm216 during the grinding did allow obtaining the drug as an amorphous powder by reduction of the aggregation . interestingly , the effect on solubility was quite dependent on the polymer used , with gelatin , polyvinylpyrrolidinone and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose showing marked improvement of dissolution rate over drug alone . the ratio of drug : β - cyclodextrin or drug : polymer also has some effect on solubility , with solubility generally increasing at higher β - cyclodextrin : drug or polymer : drug ratios . ratios of drug : β - cyclodextrin or drug : polymer of from about 1 : 1 to about 1 : 15 ( w / w ) can be used with ratios of from about 1 : 4 to 1 : 15 being preferred and ratios of from about 1 : 9 to about 1 : 15 being most preferred . table i below shows dissolution results when various jm216 : polymer or jm216 : β - cyclodextrin mixtures , after grinding with an automatic mortar for three hours , were evaluated in a standard dissolution test . table 1______________________________________dissolution of jm216 dissolved jm216 ( mg / ml ) 1 min . 5 min . 15 min . 30 min . 60 min . ______________________________________jm216 bulk drug alone 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 5jm216 : gelatin ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) 1 . 4 1 . 2 1 . 2 1 . 1 1 . 1jm216 : gelatin ( 1 : 4 , w / w ) 1 . 1 1 . 1 1 . 0 0 . 9 1 . 0jm216 : gelatin ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 6jm216 : hpmc ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) 0 . 9 1 . 1 1 . 0 0 . 9 0 . 9jm216 : hpmc ( 1 : 4 , w / w ) 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7jm216 : hpmc ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 6 0 . 6 0 . 6jm216 : pvp ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 0 . 9 0 . 9jm216 : pullulan 0 . 5 0 . 8 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) jm216 : peg 6000 0 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 5 ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) jm216 : avicel ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7jm216 : lactose 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) jm216 : β -

cyclodextrin or jm216 : polymer mixtures may be accomplished by standard procedures , e . g . automatic mortar and pestle machines or a hybridizer ( milling machine ). the time needed in the grinding process may be readily determined by simple test ( period analysis of the mixture by x - ray diffraction studies ). a suitable grinding time with the automatic mortar and pestle machine is three hours and with the hybridizer , five minutes . as can be seen from table i , use of amorphous jm216 with β - cyclodextrin or certain polymer additives significantly increases the water - solubility of jm216 . the preferred formulations with increased solubility are those where the jm216 is ground to an amorphous state in the following drug : β - cyclodextrin or drug : polymer ratios : such formulations result in approximately a doubling of the aqueous solubility over bulk jm216 powder alone and are one important aspect of the present invention . such amorphous jm216 can be used in a wide variety of jm216 pharmaceutical formulations , including both oral and non - oral forms , to improve the bioavailability of jm216 . the present inventors also explored developing a suppository dosage form of jm216 which would provide an alternative dosage form for those patients unable to use the current oral capsules . it was a goal to develop such a suppository dosage form which would have better absorption than the oral form and reduced side effects , e . g . nausea and vomitting . in their studies in vitro drug absorption of the test formulations was examined using excised rat rectum in accordance with the method described by t . ogiso et al in j . pharmacobio - dyn ., 14 , 385 ( 1991 ). the rectum was freshly excised from each rat and was opened lengthwise using scissors . the excised rectum , serous membrane side down , was mounted on a franz diffusion cell ( reservoir volume 10 ml , 7 mm i . d . o ring flange ). each preparation ( 80 mg ., 2 mg as jm216 ) was uniformly applied to the mucosal side and was occluded with a sheet of aluminum foil . gentamicin solution ( 10 mg / ml ) was added to the reservoir fluid ( phosphate buffer , ph 7 . 3 ) in the ratio of 1 : 100 . the assembly was incubated at 37 ° c . and aliquots ( 200 ( μl ) of the reservoir fluid were periodically withdrawn for 23 hours . the amount of jm216 permeated through rat rectum was determined by hplc . the various test samples were incorporated into standard suppository bases and then subjected to the in vitro drug absorption test . in addition , jm 216 powder alone and the ground anhydrous jm216 : β - cyclodextrin or jm216 : polymer mixture suspended in water were also subjected to the tests . the suppository samples were prepared by fusion method melting the base at 50 ° c . for fatty bases or at 75 ° c . for polyethylene glycol water - soluble base . the drug was incorporated into the base at a concentration of 2 mg / 80 mg base . medium chain fatty acids ( or na salts thereof ) and surface active agents were also added at the appropriate level . the results in the rat rectum absorption model are as shown below in table ii . table ii__________________________________________________________________________jm216 absorption through excised rat rectum suppository jm216 absorbed (%) drug additives bases 14 h 17 h 20 h 23 h__________________________________________________________________________jm216 water 0 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 0 ( non -

amorphous ) was little absorbed in the form of a suspension in water or in fatty suppository bases . the drug alone was , however , absorbed to some extent when incorporated into the water - soluble base , polyethylene glycol ( peg ). peg was thus determined to be the most appropriate suppository base for jm216 . peg having molecular weights of from about 400 - 6000 is preferred ( the peg used in the above study was a mixture of 400 , 1500 and 4000 ( 2 : 1 : 5 , w / w ) molecular weight material ). based on their experience , the present inventors determined that in the rat rectum absorption model a percentage absorption of 4 % or greater was considered necessary for a commercially useful suppository formulation of jm216 . addition of certain fatty acids to the peg suppository base containing non -

Do not incorporate any external knowledge or infer any details beyond what is given in the passage. Provide a concise summary of the following passage, covering the core pieces of information described.\n\nPassage:\n\"jm216 is a platinum antitumor complex having poor water - solubility . this low solubility may be associated with bioavailability problems seen in a recent phase i clinical study where the compound was orally administered in the form of hard gelatin capsules with excipients ( microcrystalline cellulose , sodium starch glycolate , lactose anhydrous and magnesium stearate ). it was an object of the present invention to find a way of increasing the aqueous solubility of jm216 so as to improve the bioavailability of the compound and perhaps also eliminate or reduce side effects seen with oral dosing such as nausea and vomitting . it was another object of the invention to develop a suppository dosage formulation of jm216 which could provide the same therapeutic advantages of the existing oral formulation while also improving the bioavailability . it was hoped that the suppository formulation would also have an improved side - effect profile as well as being an alternate dosage form for those patients who cannot tolerate oral dosing , e . g . infant patients or patients with disorders of the digestive organs . the present inventors first attempted to reduce the particle size of the jm216 powder obtained from chemical synthesis by grinding or milling it to an amorphous state ( as confirmed by x - ray diffraction pattern ). the amorphous state indicates the disappearance of particles or crystalline drug and a particle size close to the molecular level . however , it was found to be very difficult to obtain an amorphous state by simply grinding the drug alone owing to the re - aggregation of drug powder by electrostatic force during the grinding process . the addition of β - cyclodextrin or polymers to the jm216 during the grinding did allow obtaining the drug as an amorphous powder by reduction of the aggregation . interestingly , the effect on solubility was quite dependent on the polymer used , with gelatin , polyvinylpyrrolidinone and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose showing marked improvement of dissolution rate over drug alone . the ratio of drug : β - cyclodextrin or drug : polymer also has some effect on solubility , with solubility generally increasing at higher β - cyclodextrin : drug or polymer : drug ratios . ratios of drug : β - cyclodextrin or drug : polymer of from about 1 : 1 to about 1 : 15 ( w / w ) can be used with ratios of from about 1 : 4 to 1 : 15 being preferred and ratios of from about 1 : 9 to about 1 : 15 being most preferred . table i below shows dissolution results when various jm216 : polymer or jm216 : β - cyclodextrin mixtures , after grinding with an automatic mortar for three hours , were evaluated in a standard dissolution test . table 1______________________________________dissolution of jm216 dissolved jm216 ( mg / ml ) 1 min . 5 min . 15 min . 30 min . 60 min . ______________________________________jm216 bulk drug alone 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 5jm216 : gelatin ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) 1 . 4 1 . 2 1 . 2 1 . 1 1 . 1jm216 : gelatin ( 1 : 4 , w / w ) 1 . 1 1 . 1 1 . 0 0 . 9 1 . 0jm216 : gelatin ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 6jm216 : hpmc ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) 0 . 9 1 . 1 1 . 0 0 . 9 0 . 9jm216 : hpmc ( 1 : 4 , w / w ) 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7jm216 : hpmc ( 1 : 1 , w / w ) 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 6 0 . 6 0 . 6jm216 : pvp ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 0 . 9 0 . 9jm216 : pullulan 0 . 5 0 . 8 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) jm216 : peg 6000 0 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 5 0 . 5 ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) jm216 : avicel ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7jm216 : lactose 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 0 . 7 ( 1 : 9 , w / w ) jm216 : β -

cyclodextrin or jm216 : polymer mixtures may be accomplished by standard procedures , e . g . automatic mortar and pestle machines or a hybridizer ( milling machine ). the time needed in the grinding process may be readily determined by simple test ( period analysis of the mixture by x - ray diffraction studies ). a suitable grinding time with the automatic mortar and pestle machine is three hours and with the hybridizer , five minutes . as can be seen from table i , use of amorphous jm216 with β - cyclodextrin or certain polymer additives significantly increases the water - solubility of jm216 . the preferred formulations with increased solubility are those where the jm216 is ground to an amorphous state in the following drug : β - cyclodextrin or drug : polymer ratios : such formulations result in approximately a doubling of the aqueous solubility over bulk jm216 powder alone and are one important aspect of the present invention . such amorphous jm216 can be used in a wide variety of jm216 pharmaceutical formulations , including both oral and non - oral forms , to improve the bioavailability of jm216 . the present inventors also explored developing a suppository dosage form of jm216 which would provide an alternative dosage form for those patients unable to use the current oral capsules . it was a goal to develop such a suppository dosage form which would have better absorption than the oral form and reduced side effects , e . g . nausea and vomitting . in their studies in vitro drug absorption of the test formulations was examined using excised rat rectum in accordance with the method described by t . ogiso et al in j . pharmacobio - dyn ., 14 , 385 ( 1991 ). the rectum was freshly excised from each rat and was opened lengthwise using scissors . the excised rectum , serous membrane side down , was mounted on a franz diffusion cell ( reservoir volume 10 ml , 7 mm i . d . o ring flange ). each preparation ( 80 mg ., 2 mg as jm216 ) was uniformly applied to the mucosal side and was occluded with a sheet of aluminum foil . gentamicin solution ( 10 mg / ml ) was added to the reservoir fluid ( phosphate buffer , ph 7 . 3 ) in the ratio of 1 : 100 . the assembly was incubated at 37 ° c . and aliquots ( 200 ( μl ) of the reservoir fluid were periodically withdrawn for 23 hours . the amount of jm216 permeated through rat rectum was determined by hplc . the various test samples were incorporated into standard suppository bases and then subjected to the in vitro drug absorption test . in addition , jm 216 powder alone and the ground anhydrous jm216 : β - cyclodextrin or jm216 : polymer mixture suspended in water were also subjected to the tests . the suppository samples were prepared by fusion method melting the base at 50 ° c . for fatty bases or at 75 ° c . for polyethylene glycol water - soluble base . the drug was incorporated into the base at a concentration of 2 mg / 80 mg base . medium chain fatty acids ( or na salts thereof ) and surface active agents were also added at the appropriate level . the results in the rat rectum absorption model are as shown below in table ii . table ii__________________________________________________________________________jm216 absorption through excised rat rectum suppository jm216 absorbed (%) drug additives bases 14 h 17 h 20 h 23 h__________________________________________________________________________jm216 water 0 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 0 ( non -

6000 is preferred ( the peg used in the above study was a mixture of 400 , 1500 and 4000 ( 2 : 1 : 5 , w / w ) molecular weight material ). based on their experience , the present inventors determined that in the rat rectum absorption model a percentage absorption of 4 % or greater was considered necessary for a commercially useful suppository formulation of jm216 . addition of certain fatty acids to the peg suppository base containing non - amorphous jm216 gave the desired absorption levels while similar peg formulations without these fatty acids were unacceptable . the amorphous jm216 produced by grinding or milling jm216 with β - cyclodextrin or polymers , particularly gelatin , hpmc or pvp , can also be added to a peg suppository base and certain fatty acids , particulary caproic acid or its sodium salt , caprylic acid or its sodium salt , capric acid or its sodium salt and the sodium salt of oleic acid , to obtain a suppository dosage form having excellent absorption properties . the fatty acid is used in an amount of from 0 . 5 to 10 % ( w / w ) of the total suppository weight . addition of surface active agents to the suppositories employing a peg base , amorphous jm216 and a fatty acid selected from caproic acid or its sodium salt , caprylic acid or its sodium salt , capric acid or its sodium salt and the sodium salt of oleic acid also resulted in suppository formulations showing high absorption . again , in the case of amorphous jm216 , material made by grinding jm216 with gelatin , hpmc , pvp or β -
