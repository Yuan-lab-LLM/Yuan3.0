Sometimes referred to mistakenly as physician’s assistants, physician assistants are medical providers who are licensed to diagnose and treat illness and disease and to prescribe medication for patients. They work in physician offices, hospitals and clinics in collaboration with a licensed physician. The physician-PA relationship is fundamental to the profession and enhances the delivery of high-quality health care. Because of their advanced education in general medicine, modeled after physician education, physician assistants can treat patients with significant autonomy. In a primary care setting, physician assistants can provide nearly all of the clinical services a physician does, including: Every day, thousands of people have access to quality health care because there are physician assistants in their communities. Physician assistants are critical to increasing access to care for rural and other underserved patients as they are often the only health providers in these areas. Nearly 300 million patient visits were made to physician assistants, and approximately 332 million medications were prescribed or recommended by physician assistants in 2008. Physician assistants also work in specialties outside of primary care, including medical and surgical specialties and sub-specialties. In 2019, PAs held over 104,000 jobs, with hospitals employing 41.1% of PAs and office-based private practices employing 38.6%. 5.2% were employed in federal government facilities, 4.8% in community health centers or rural health clinics, and 4.6% in urgent cares. Working Conditions | Academic Requirements | ResourcesWorking ConditionsPhysician assistants usually work in a comfortable, well-lighted environment. Those in surgery often stand for long periods, and others may do considerable walking. Schedules will vary according to practice setting or may depend on the hours of the collaborating physician. The workweek of physician assistants may include weekends, nights and early morning hospital rounds to visit patients. They may also be on call at certain times, including nights and weekends.<n><n>title: , source: ResourcesAccreditation Review Commission on Education for Physician AssistantsAmerican Academy of Physician AssistantsCentral Application Service for Physician AssistantsNational Commission on Certification of Physician AssistantsPhysician Assistant Education AssociationThe Physician Assistant Education Association reviewed this career profile.

It offers the flexibility to move into different areas of medicine without additional education and training. Academic RequirementsTo practice as a physician assistant, you must graduate from an accredited PA program, pass the national certification exam and obtain a license in the state in which you wish to practice. You cannot bypass any of those steps and must complete them in order. It is important to carefully review the prerequisite course requirements of all programs because they may vary, in some cases greatly. In general, requirements may include a completed bachelor’s degree, science and non-science prerequisites courses, minimum GPAs, health care experience and standardized exams. The number of accredited PA programs has increased from 210 in 2016 to 260 in 2020 and all programs offer a master’s degree. The Physician Assistant Education Association provides a list of PA programs. The list is updated in May each year and can be used to search for programs and to compare admissions criteria. The Central Application Service for Physician Assistants (CASPA) makes it easy to apply to multiple PA programs using a single application, one set of transcripts, one set of letters of recommendation and one personal statement.

They must also take the PANCE during the tenth year of their recertification cycle. Physician assistants who do not pass this exam on their first attempt can retake it up to three more times.What Does a Physician Assistant Do?So, what is a PA? Physician assistants are healthcare professionals with academic and practical training similar to physicians and surgeons. PAs work under the supervision of physicians and can act as primary healthcare providers. You won’t find a healthcare team without them. PAs function like doctors; they diagnose ailments, prescribe medications, examine patients, devise treatment plans, and write referrals to specialists.No matter their specialization, PAs are responsible for meeting with patients. They must communicate and research critical information and make decisions about patient management. They can work in various medical settings and specialties in roles such as the following: Surgical physician assistantPhysician Assistant ResponsibilitiesPhysician assistants practice and learn medicine alongside nurses, doctors, and therapists. They typically specialize in a medical discipline, such as: PsychiatryPA responsibilities may resemble a doctor’s, but they are not the same. The main difference is that physician assistant education takes much less time than becoming a doctor.Still, PAs can find employment options in clinics, hospitals, doctor’s offices, healthcare centers, or other medical centers. The prime responsibilities of a physician assistant may vary depending on the state, service area, specialty, and place of employment. In urban areas, they may take on a much narrower role, exclusively sewing up incisions after surgeries or administering vaccinations to pediatric patients.

AGNPs perform physical exams and diagnoses for adults of all ages. Acute-care AGNPs treat existing illnesses and are more likely to work in hospitals, while primary-care AGNPs focus on preventative care. Family nurse practitioners (FNPs) comprise the largest percentage of NPs. FNPs care for patients of all ages and life stages, providing preventative care and treatment for illnesses, conditions, and injuries. They work in clinics, hospitals, and private practice. Women's health NPs care for women of all ages, providing healthcare specific to women, including gynecology and obstetrics. They find employment in hospitals, clinics, and fertility centers and often collaborate with physicians and nurse midwives. Employed primarily in hospital neonatal intensive care units, these professionals care for infants born prematurely or with illnesses. They provide acute and critical care to newborns and ongoing treatments like incubation, tube feedings, IV lines, and medications. ERNPs collaborate with teams of healthcare providers to help patients experiencing medical emergencies. This fast-paced career involves assessing, diagnosing, and treating patients undergoing trauma, severe injuries, and emotional crises. Other responsibilities may include supervising RNs and educating patients. Pediatric nurse practitioners (PNPs) specialize in primary or acute care of infants, children, and teens. PNPs see patients in physicians' offices, hospitals, and outpatient care centers. Acute care specialists work in emergency rooms, intensive care units, and urgent care clinics. A pain management NP career involves administering and monitoring medication, along with providing non-pharmaceutical options like acupuncture and chiropractic care. Common workplaces include cancer and surgical units in hospitals or rehabilitation facilities. As some of the highest-paid nursing professionals, NPs earn an average annual salary of $118,000 or nearly $57 per hour., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). NP salaries can vary by levels of education and experience, specialization area, workplace, and geographic location.<n><n>title: , source: For example, NPs in home health care services make an average salary of $133,170, compared to $129,190 for those employed at outpatient care centers. And NPs in California outearn their counterparts in other states. The top 10 highest-paying metro areas for NPs are also in California. Job prospects look especially promising for NPs. The BLS projects a 46% rise in employment for NPs during 2021-2031 – the fastest growth rate among occupations nationwide. The table below lists the top five states for NP salaries and the average annual wages. NP salaries also vary by workplace settings, but the most common industries that employ NPs, including physicians' offices, hospitals, and higher educational institutions, do not necessarily offer the highest salaries. Job-seekers hoping to earn top dollar may want to explore the workplaces listed in the table below. The NP designation takes at least six years of school to earn, plus time working as an RN. Most full-time students need four years to earn a BSN degree versus two for an ADN and two years to earn a master's degree in nursing. Most schools require or strongly recommend at least two years of work as an RN before applying to an MSN-NP program. NPs can prescribe medications, including controlled substances. Some states require a certain number of credit hours in pharmacology, while others require NPs or newly credentialed NPs to collaborate with a physician. Others grant NPs full-practice authority, meaning they do not require a physician's collaboration or supervision. The American Association of Nurse Practitioners reports the distribution of NPs by primary practice area. In 2020, family nurse practitioners topped the list, with nearly 70% of NPs choosing this specialty. The second most popular specialization was adult care at 10.8%, followed by adult-gerontology primary care at 7%. An RN has a two- or four-year degree in nursing, or a nursing diploma, whereas an NP has at least an MSN and board certification as an NP. While all NPs are RNs, not all RNs are NPs.<n><n>title: , source: Our contributing writers leverage diverse educational and professional backgrounds to create content for NurseJournal.

Highly trained nurse practitioners (NPs) specialize in patient populations and hold advanced nursing degrees. They can focus on acute care, family healthcare, oncology, or mental health. NPs are licensed as advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) and earn national board certification in their specialty areas. NPs are primary care providers who perform many of the same services as physicians. They often have greater autonomy compared to registered nurses. Depending on state regulations, some jurisdictions allow full practice authority, while others require a collaborative agreement with a doctor. NPs provide clinical care for patients and are authorized to diagnose health conditions, order tests, and prescribe medications. NPs' scope of work varies depending on their specialization area, the population they serve, and the state where they practice. One of their main roles within healthcare is to address the shortage of physicians and bring down healthcare costs. In some states, they need to work under the supervision of a physician or in collaboration with a physician; in other states, they have full-practice authority, giving them professional autonomy. NP specializations usually correspond with patient populations. For example, pediatric nurse practitioners work with patients from birth to age 21, and women's healthcare nurse practitioners serve women. Certain states let NPs establish private practices, but regulations vary.<n><n>title: , source: The first nurse practitioner program started in 1965 in Colorado. That same year, Medicare and Medicaid expansion increased the number of Americans who qualified for coverage and could seek primary healthcare. In 2018, an estimated 56,000 NPs practiced in the U.S. The rise of the NP profession came in response to the lack of primary care physicians available to meet this need. Nurse practitioners serve an important role in helping to address the continuing primary care shortage, lowering healthcare costs, and improving patient satisfaction. Nurse practitioners stand out from other healthcare providers by looking at patient health and well-being from a whole-person perspective. Throughout the profession's history, NPs have advocated for policy changes to improve healthcare and access, particularly for children, low-income individuals, and other marginalized groups. Physicians' offices employ more than 40% of nurse practitioners, followed by outpatient care centers at 23%, and hospitals and offices of other health practitioners at nearly 10% each. The remainder work in settings like home health care services. NPs generally serve as primary care providers or specialists in hospital outpatient settings, assessing and diagnosing patients, prescribing treatment, advising patients on care, and referring patients to physicians for additional care when needed. In a hospital inpatient setting, NPs also assess and diagnose patients and prescribe treatment as part of a patient's ongoing care. They may also lead nursing teams and oversee the work of other clinical staff. In a private group practice, NPs may serve as primary care providers or specialists. They see patients, assess conditions, and prescribe treatments, escalating a patient to seeing a physician or specialist NP as necessary. There are pros and cons to any occupation, and NPs are no different. You can compare key qualities of an NP found in the list below. Becoming a nurse practitioner is a multi-step process that starts with an undergraduate nursing degree and registered nurse (RN) license. After gaining experience as an RN, aspiring NPs complete a graduate nursing program, followed by board certification and advanced practice licensing.<n><n>title: , source: Students can earn an ADN in two years or a BSN in four years. Some students prefer to earn the ADN first, allowing them to see if they like the work and environment. Others prefer to start with the BSN and begin work at a higher level of responsibility and pay. Master of science in nursing (MSN)-NP programs require experience in nursing. To practice as an RN, you must pass the National Council Licensure Examination for RNs (NCLEX-RN) examination, which measures a graduate's readiness to begin practice as a registered nurse. It asks questions about safety, health promotion, and patient physical and psychological needs. Students typically take two years of full-time study to earn an MSN degree. Admission for most MSN programs requires or prefers students with at least two years of RN experience. MSN-NP programs also require a valid, unencumbered state nursing license. This examination, like the NCLEX-RN exam, assesses a graduate's readiness to work in the field as an NP. It typically comprises 150 multiple-choice questions. However, there are several certifying bodies with differing exams depending on your MSN-NP specialty track, such as family nurse practitioner, adult-gerontology primary care nurse practitioner, and pediatric nurse practitioner. Each state has its licensing requirements, but all require NPs to earn an MSN or doctor of nursing practice (DNP) degree and pass the national board exam. Popular nurse practitioner specializations include women's, family, and neonatal health. We explain these and other specialties below. Licensure and national certification requirements vary by state and specialization.

APRNs enjoy additional benefits such as States with the highest yearly mean wages for nurse practitioners are as follows:  Use the map below to compare nurse practitioner salary estimates by state. The first step to a career as a nurse practitioner is earning your credentials as a registered nurse (RN). There are a number of academic paths to reach this particular goal -- specifically, an associate or bachelor's degree from an accredited institution of higher education, or a diploma from an approved vocational training program. (Prospective nurses should note that these diploma programs have become less popular due to the fact that many employers in the healthcare sector now require clinician employees to have a college  Some educational trajectories combine the steps of becoming an RN and earning a bachelor's degree, and some programs offer accelerated tracks for those with previous non-nursing bachelor's degrees. Students may choose to first become a licensed practical nurse (LPN) on the road to becoming an RN. For both the LPN and the RN credentials, graduates of nursing programs must pass a standardized national examination and also obtain a state license. Another key milestone for aspiring NPs is earning a bachelor's degree, the usual prerequisite for graduate studies. The undergraduate major is most often nursing, but a limited number of  Bachelor's degree programs in nursing usually include a substantial clinical component, as well as courses<n><n>title: , source:  A Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) is the minimum degree requirement for becoming a nurse practitioner. It is also currently the most common degree program in the field, although some experts note a growing movement toward requiring all nurse practitioners to earn a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree.  Another possibility is to earn a master's degree in nursing and then a PhD in a related field, particularly for those with career goals related to healthcare administration, nursing education or research. Graduate programs provide in-depth study of medical ethics, diagnosis, and anatomy among other subjects.  Regardless of graduate degree level, the curriculum for a nurse practitioner follows the general course of study for an advanced practice registered nurse (APRN), with specialized NP education and training. Students focus on a specialty such as family and primary care, women's health, geriatrics or psychiatry.  Graduate nursing studies include both classroom education and clinical training. Coursework covers a broad range of subjects including anatomy, physiology and pharmacology, as well as field-specific classes that explore pediatrics, family or primary care, gerontology, health systems management and more. Students pursuing a master's (MSN) degree can plan for approximately 18 to 24 months of full-time study, while DNP programs typically require a two- to three-year Each state has its own specific licensing requirements, and it is essential that individuals understand those requirements before beginning their education and training. States typically publish a list of approved graduate-level programs that qualify toward nurse practitioner licensing in that particular jurisdiction. Nurse practitioner licensure candidates must hold a master's degree in nursing and a valid state RN license, and also pass a national certification  National certification for nurse practitioners is available from various professional associations, depending on a candidate's chosen area of specialization.

Nurse practitioners get advanced training in nursing so they can take their careers a step farther. By getting graduate-level education, they can operate independently or under the supervision of a physician. Many are hired by hospitals or doctor's offices to provide support and services to an individual physician or team of doctors. A nurse practitioner begins as a registered nurse (RN) and then moves on to get a master's and sometimes a doctoral degree. Prospective NPs need to consider what type of specialty most interests them and in what type of organization or setting they want to work. Use this guide to learn more about nurse practitioner careers, degrees, salaries and industry trends. Nurse practitioners (NPs) are a type of Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) whose specialized education and clinical training allow them to provide higher levels of care and perform a variety of tasks that RNs are not licensed to do. Nurse practitioners often focus on specific areas or populations, including pediatrics, geriatrics, mental health or adult medicine. They may complete an advanced degree program that allows them to practice independently The rules governing nurse practitioners vary from state to state, but typically include such tasks as performing   physical assessments, diagnosing illnesses, ordering and analyzing diagnostic tests and procedures, and managing   patient treatment. Nurse practitioners can also prescribe medications within limits. However, the prescribing of   controlled substances may be tightly regulated or prohibited in some states.<n><n>title: , source:   a strong command of the English language, and develop social perceptiveness skills and reading comprehension   skills to perform at their job.

Eligibility for certification typically requires at least an RN license, a degree from an accredited institution, and a certain number of supervised clinical hours.  Registered Nurses obtain additional credentials relating to a specific area of specialization or a certain patient population. Opportunities for advancement increase with education, certification and work experience in one or more specialties. Even without this additional specialization, nursing professionals are lifelong learners, since maintaining certification requires a certain amount of continuing education credits throughout one's career.  Examples of specialization as an APRN include Acute Care Pediatric Nurse Practitioner (ACNP), Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (AG ACNP), Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) and Pediatric Nurse Practitioner (PNP).  To become a nurse practitioner, students must first get their basic nursing education by obtaining an associate in   science degree to become a registered nurse (RN) or by completing a four-year bachelor's degree in nursing (BSN). Once   they have completed their undergraduate education, students can enroll in a graduate program to obtain a master's   degree in nursing (MSN), which is required to become a licensed nurse practitioner.  Admission into a master's degree program typically requires clinical experience, letters of reference, and a   declaration of a specialty. Coursework in specialty areas can vary but typically include lab work and a comprehensive   exam. Upon completion of a master's degree, students must pass the national certification exam and obtain a license to Those interested in becoming a nurse practitioner have a few different options at the undergraduate level.

Different breeds of goats are adapted to different livestock systems - from small herds of 3-5 heads on meager grazing to large intensive livestock farms, from year-round grazing to fully stable housing, with many intermediate variations between them. Goats are a source of several types of products, of which the main ones are milk, meat and wool. Among the goat breeds there are highly productive specialized, dual-triple-use and universal breeds. External differences between breeds are represented by many major and minor traits that vary in a very wide range. Goat breeds (especially dairy goats) are some of the oldest defined animal breeds for which breed standards and production records have been kept. Selective breeding of goats generally focuses on improving production of fiber, meat, dairy products or goatskin. Breeds are generally classified based on their primary use, though there are several breeds which are considered dual- or multi-purpose.

A census in the Cape Colony in 1891 found 3444019 head.[6]: 65  Boer goats commonly have white bodies and distinctive brown heads. Some Boer goats can be completely brown or white or paint, which means large spots of a different color are on their bodies. Like the Nubian goat, they possess long, pendulous ears. They are noted for being docile, fast-growing, and having high fertility rates. Ewes are reported to have superior mothering skills as compared to other breeds.  Boer goats tend to gain weight at about the same rate as their sire, so a ram from a proven fast-growing bloodline will command the highest price, as its offspring  tend to also be fast growers. The primary market for slaughter goats is a 22–36 kg (49–79 lb) kid; kids should reach marketable size at weaning age. The kid of a proven fast-growing sire might weigh 36 kg (79 lb) at 90 days, while the kid of a poor-quality sire might weigh only 15 kg (33 lb) at 90 days. An average-quality ram will initially be less expensive to purchase, but it can significantly undermine an operation's long-term profitability.<n><n>title: , source: ^ a b Transboundary breed: Boer.

It may also be used in vegetation management, and is kept for this purpose in some areas of thornveld.[7]: 83  Boer goats are polyestrous (they can breed throughout the year), and they reach sexual maturity at five months of age. A typical breeding program is to produce three kid crops every two years, meaning the ewes are pregnant for five months, nurse their kids for three months, and then are rebred. Multiple births are common, and a 200% kid crop is achievable in managed herds. Usually, first-time ewes have one kid, but they may have more. After that, they usually have two kids every other breeding. The kids can be brown, black, white, or mixed. Common crosses are Boer x Spanish goat, Boer x Angora goat, Boer x Kiko goat, Boer x Nubian goat, Boer x Sirohi, Boer x Osmanabadi, and Boer x Jamnapari goat.[citation needed] An effort to crossbreed with the Malabari goat has been controversial.[8] ^ Barbara Rischkowsky, Dafydd Pilling (editors) (2007).

A lot of our knowledge came from reading information on dairy goats and pairing that with the fiber production of sheep. But mostly, we decided to jump in and over the years we’ve collected a wealth of knowledge through trial and error. It’s my hope that over the next few posts I can help solve some of the mystery around these amazing animals and help you to learn to make a profit. In the everyday care of fiber goats, it’s much like raising any other goat. They have a very mild temperament, and though they might be hardier than sheep, they are the most delicate of goat breeds. Angora goats are the most productive fiber animal in the world. They are shorn twice a year and produce a very soft, very insulated fiber. All that fiber production takes a lot of energy from the animal. Does will often produce only 1 offspring per season. Angora mothers have been known to not produce enough milk if they give birth to more than 1. We’ve taken milk from our Nubians and fed it to our Angora kids to give them a head start. The most important thing to realize about fiber goats is that they need extra nutrition, mainly in the form of fats to make lanolin to protect their mohair and protein to grow those long locks. Quality goat feed at 14% protein level min. They also do well with the addition of alfalfa hay, or beet pulp. Black oil sunflower seeds for needed oils for the production of lanolin. Parasite loads are harder on Angoras. I find I need to worm them more regularly than the dairy goats and that their wormer needs to be changed up more often to be effective.<n><n>title: , source: Like all fiber animals, Angoras are prone to lice infestations. We check their skin and fleece regularly to check for lice nits and eggs. Regular de-lousing is essential. Lice will negatively impact health and the quality of the fleece. A goat’s horn is not just used for defense they also serve as the animals’ cooling system and body temperature regulation. If you’ve ever touched a goat’s horns, you’ll notice that they are usually warm. They are not just dead protein like a fingernail, but instead, have a blood supply and serve an internal function. If you de-horn an Angora, it will overheat in warm weather under all that fiber. In the dairy goat world, there is the question, “what to do with the male offspring?” In the Angora world, the wether (neutered male) is the most valuable. The energy it takes for intact males and does to produce reproductive hormones actually affects fiber production. You will get the best fleece and longest fibers from wethers. When it comes to bedding for our animals I prefer pine flakes. They’re easy to shovel and the pine oils make for a fresh smelling stall. However, with Angoras, the flakes become embedded in the fleece and make a mess when it comes to processing the fiber. Because of this, we use straw with our Angoras. Most every goat I know hates rain! Angora goats especially need shelter from rain because their fleece will fill with water and in cooler temperatures, they can develop pneumonia. A dry shelter is particularly important for Fiber goats. Check back for my next post on making money with Angora Goats for how-to’s on shearing, processing the fiber and marketing.

I’m not exactly sure where the notion came to me. I faintly remember watching a children’s program that showed the process, maybe Mr. Roger’s Neighborhood? I remember taking the dog’s 2 slicker combs and trying to work cotton balls between the two brushes like I had watched the lady in the show do with wool. All it did was make a giant knot, and as my mother shook her head, I spent the afternoon picking shredded cotton out of the dog brush. I was not easily discouraged and from a very young age, I decided that I wanted to raise sheep…or so I thought. Fast forward 10-12 years. At this point, I was actually old enough to where raising sheep might be a possibility. I started doing research and found that sheep seemed to be rather delicate creatures. I rented a book from the library (pre-internet days) on how to raise sheep and the section on possible diseases that sheep can get was larger than the rest of the book combined. This left me weary. I know that I get really attached to animals and I didn’t know if I wanted to raise a breed that I could lose to death for something very small. I’ve since learned that these diseases are not as common as they once seemed. At the present, I would not be wary about adding sheep to our farm at all. But at the time it seemed scary. In my research, I found that there was such a thing as a fiber producing goat. I had no idea! According to quite a few sources, goats were a much more hearty animal compared to sheep.

Can you harvest any of your forage for hay for winter feeding? If all the forage produced on an acre of land could be harvested as hay and measured in tons (or hay equivalent per acre), you would have an estimate of your land's productive capacity. Suppose you have 20 acres, of which 5 acres are rough poor pasture and will produce about one ton H.E., 5 are average and will produce two or more tons of H.E., and 10 are good to excellent and should produce four tons of H.E. per acre. Your total production would be 5 x 1 = 5, plus 5 x 2 = 10, plus 10 x 4 = 40. This equals a total estimated H.E. of 55 tons. An average doe requires 1 ton of hay/year (half of this comes from pasture). So in this example, you should have enough forage for about 55 does. This method is, of course, only an estimate. But it is a quick, easy and a reasonably accurate method to evaluate your land resources for goats. Remember that about half of the forage production would be consumed as pasture and the rest as harvested forage in the winter. Farmers who are adding on a goat enterprise probably already have the production capability needed, but others may be wise to purchase hay. If you start with 50 or fewer does and only 15 or 20 tons of hay are required, purchasing hay seems reasonable. Whatever feed system you decide on, remember that any investment in harvesting equipment must be paid for by the goats. A small herd cannot cover the costs of large tractors, forage harvesters, and other major equipment. The University of Illinois has a program titled "Illini Graze" to help producers estimate the amount of forage they have available on their farm. To purchase one of these, contact Dean Oswald at 309-836-2265, or email at oswaldd@uiuc.edu<n><n>title: , source: Buildings: Do you have buildings to house the number of does you want in the winter, along with their kids and any replacements you will have. You will need about 20 square feet for each doe. For example, with a 55-doe herd, you would need about 20 x 55, or 1,100 square feet for the animals. (The exact amount will depend on your production system.). Dry (non-lactating) does need only modest protection, even in winter, if they are well fed, while does with January kids need more. Most old dairy barns, machine sheds and outbuildings can be converted to excellent quarters for goats. But remember, goats should have an open, cold, dry barn rather than a tight, warm, humid barn. Machinery and Equipment: Do you have the equipment to clip pastures and clean barns? Or, will you be hiring out labor? If you are harvesting hay, do you have that machinery? If you only need about 100 tons of hay, it may be cheaper and easier to buy the hay than to make it. What about goat equipment? You will need proper fences (high-tensile electric), holding pens, sorting pens and chutes for restraint. You will also need small pieces of equipment for foot trimming, ear tagging, trimming show goats and possibly for shearing if you choose Angora goats. Labor: Do you have the time to properly care for the animals? You should check on your goats twice a day. Refill feed and water, if needed. During these checks, take a few minutes to stand and observe your goats. If you know what normal is for your goats, a sick one will be quickly found. Timeliness of goat management tasks is very important. You must have time to do the jobs when required and not put them off until next week or next month. An example of this would be your ability to evaluate your animals for internal parasites and respond if worming is necessary at that time.<n><n>title: , source: Are You Thinking of Raising Meat Goats? - Sheep & Goats  Planning Sheep and Goat Fencing For Improved Animal Control and Reduced Predation A. Richard Cobb, Extension Sheep and Meat Goat Specialist, University of Illinois Interest in meat goats has increased dramatically in Illinois in the last few years. An increasing demand for goat meat, spurred by a growing ethnic population in Chicago and throughout the state, has demonstrated a need for increased commercial meat production. In addition, importation of new breeds has stimulated a breeding industry which needs herds to produce purebred breeding stock as well as animals for exhibition. The above opportunities have stimulated a number of people in Illinois to investigate raising meat goats. However, many of them are not familiar with modern meat goat production techniques. Because the interest in meat goat production is new, there are few experienced goat producers in Illinois to help newcomers in their desire to learn as much as possible about meat goat production. This is an attempt to aid newcomers in their goal to become successful producers. The first step in meat goat production is to do an honest evaluation of the resources you have to devote to the project. Here is a list of resources you need to consider: Personal: What is your attitude towards goats and livestock in general? Do you like them? Are you comfortable working with larger animals? Do you realize that raising livestock is a 24/7/365 commitment, no matter the weather, time of day or other family, social, or work obligations? Is your family supportive of the decision to raise goats? How will you take vacations? Can you set up your farm to allow you to have your desired level of "quality of life?"  Land: How much land is available and what is its productivity? Poor ground may support 2-4 goats per acre while better pasture may be able to support 6-8 goats per acre. If you are adding goats to cattle, you can add 1-2 goats per head of cattle. Goats will eat the weeds cattle dislike, thus improving the grazing for the cattle. Improvements like better forage species and rotational grazing can increase stocking capacity. Remember, it is better to have too few goats than too many – too many will put a strain on your resources.<n><n>title: , source: Make use of pasture and browse – this will cut down on your feed bill. When and where to purchase the feed – buy a full year's supply at one time or purchase as needed? Make sure you have excellent equipment for storage and feeding. Do not feed goats concentrates on the ground. Make sure you have adequate feeder space for all animals in a pen to eat at the same time. This will greatly reduce the chance of injuries and miscarriage. Consider the size of the goats you will have. Larger animals require more floor and feeder space. Know what stage of production your does are in so you can feed them accordingly. Make sure all animals have CLEAN FRESH WATER at all times – check each day and clean all waters on a regular basis. In order to make a profit, you need does that get pregnant on the first exposure to the buck, give birth to at least twins, raise the kids to weaning, and require minimal maintenance. Tennessee State University is conducting research on profitability based on doe herd productivity and performing comparisons among different breeds of meat goats. Visit the Tennessee State University Animal Physiology Lab website for more information. All goats are amazingly adaptable. Using different breeds and systems, you can set and meet your production goals. Most Midwestern farms have the potential to produce suitable forage and, since concentrates usually can be purchased at reasonable prices, can produce at high levels. The goals you set will depend on your resources, management abilities, the ability of the goats, and the products you hope to produce. If you decide to start a goat enterprise, where you get your starter herd is critical. Be sure to purchase healthy animals. Also, don't buy on pedigree alone – it is the performance of the goat that counts, not the papers that come with the goat.<n><n>title: , source: Educate yourself - visit other goat farms, read books, visit websites, and join goat organizations. Check for a sound mouth, two teats, no lumps or sores, healthy feet, no nasal or eye discharge, clean butt, good body condition, size fits with age. Ask about their culling practices. Do not buy from a farm that sells everything as breeding stock. Make sure that they raise goats the way you will be raising them. Don't buy a pampered show goat and expect it to survive on pasture with minimal care - it will die! Start cheap – it's better to make mistakes on less expensive goats that your high dollar breeding stock. The key traits to be considered in selecting a breed for meat goat production include: adaptability to environmental and production conditions, reproductive rate, growth rate, and carcass characteristics. There are five major breeds of meat goats in the United States: Boer, Kiko, Spanish, Myotonic and Savannah. Each breed was developed with the same goal in mind: fertile, low maintenance goats able to survive in harsh conditions. While each breed has its pros and cons, the most important factor in breed selection is the individual animals you are purchasing. Boer: The Boer is a heavier goat that was developed in South Africa. This makes the Boer a good fit for drier climates such as Texas. Puberty is achieved early, at about 6 months for the males and 10-12 months for the females. A mature Boer buck weights between 240 and 300 pounds and the Boer doe weighs between 200 and 225 pounds. For some situations, this breed might be too big, with high maintenance costs. Kiko: The Kiko breed was developed in New Zealand from feral and dairy breeds and continues to be selected for specific commercially-important traits. The Kiko goat is therefore well suited to wetter climates such as the Southeast and Midwest. It performs well under a variety of conditions in forage-based meat production systems. They have good reproductive rates, growth rates, and are low maintenance. On average, mature bucks can weigh up to 200 pounds and does up to 130 pounds.<n><n>User: Please give an answer in just one sentence.

Depending upon the abnormality, the heart may begin to beat too fast, too slow, irregularly, or not at all. Heart rhythm disorders are often referred to as cardiac arrhythmias (cardiac = heart; a = lack of) but this is technically incorrect since in most cases there is a heart rhythm, but it is abnormal. Cardiac dysrhythmia (dys = abnormal or faulty + rhythm) might be a better term. Dysrhythmias may occur because of problems directly associated with the electrical "wiring," the SA node, the AV node, or the ventricular conducting system. The issue may also be due to influences on the conducting system from outside the heart. These can include electrolyte abnormalities in the bloodstream, abnormal hormone levels (for example thyroid function that is too high or too low), and medication or drug ingestions. Any abnormality of the electrical cycle within the heart that generates an abnormal beat, whether it is too fast, too slow, skipped, or irregular is considered dysrhythmia. Dysrhythmias are usually classified as originating from above the AV node (supraventricular) or below, the ventricle. They are either fast, slow, irregular and persistent, or intermittent. The heart is a two-stage electric pump whose job it is to circulate blood through the body. The initial electrical impulse that begins the process of a heartbeat is generated by a group of cells located in the upper chamber of the heart, the atrium. These cells act as an automatic pacemaker, starting the electric signal that spreads along the "wiring" within the heart muscle, allowing a coordinated squeeze so that the pump can function.<n><n>title: , source: Because of the heart rhythm abnormality, other symptoms may occur because of decreased cardiac output (the amount of blood that the heart pushes out to meet the body's demand for oxygen and energy). The patient may complain of lightheadedness, weakness, nausea and vomiting, chest pain, and shortness of breath. In critical situations, the patient may fall to the ground or lose consciousness. This may be due to life-threatening dysrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. It may be due to heart rates so fast that there isn't enough blood pressure generated to supply the brain with what it needs. The same result can also occur if the heart beats too slowly and insufficient blood pressure is generated.What are the different types of heart rhythm disorders? Heart rhythm disorders are classified according to where they occur in the heart and how they affect the heartbeat. There are twelve types of heart rhythm disorders include We'll take a look at each type in the next sections. ECG of the Abnormal Conduction of the Heart's Electrical System in AFib Atrial fibrillation occurs when the atrium has lost the ability to beat in a coordinated fashion. Instead of the SA node generating a single electrical signal, numerous areas of the atrium become irritated and produce electrical impulses. This causes the atrium to jiggle, or fibrillate, instead of beating. The AV node sees all the electrical signals, but because there are so many, and because they are so erratic, only some of the hundreds of signals per minute are passed through to the ventricle. The ventricles then fire irregularly and often very quickly. As in PSVT, the symptoms may include palpitations, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath. The cause of atrial fibrillation, however, may be more significant, since it may be due to aging of the conducting system of the heart and there may be associated atherosclerotic heart disease. Therefore, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response associated with chest pain or shortness of breath may need emergent cardioversion (a procedure that uses electricity to shock the heart back into a normal rhythm) or intravenous medications to control the heart rate.<n><n>title: , source: The heart and its electrical activity work within a narrow range of normal. Fortunately, the body tends to protect the heart as best as it can. Rhythm disturbances may be normal physiologic responses, but some may be potentially life-threatening. Every cell in the heart can act as a pacemaker. A healthy SA node has an intrinsic heartbeat generation rate of 60 to 80. If the atrium fails to generate a heartbeat, then a healthy AV node can do so at a rate of about 40, and if needed, the ventricles themselves can generate heartbeats at a rate of about 20 per minute. This may occur if the cells of the upper chamber fail to generate an electrical impulse or if the electrical signals to the ventricle are blocked. However, these lower rates may be associated with the inability of the heart to pump blood to the body to meet its needs and may result in shortness of breath, chest pain, weakness, or passing out. In the U.S., 1 in every 4 deaths is caused by heart disease. Heart rhythm disturbances may occur because of problems within the heart itself or be the result of abnormalities in the body's environment that can affect the heart's ability to conduct electricity. Cardiac or heart muscle cells become irritated when they are depleted of oxygen. This can occur during a heart attack, in which the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, are blocked. Lack of oxygen can occur when the lungs are unable to extract oxygen from the air. Significant anemia, or low red blood cell count, decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and may prevent adequate oxygen delivery. Rapid heart rates may be due to "wiring" problems with the electrical pathways in the heart. This can cause "short circuits" making the heart speed up and beat 150 beats a minute or more. The abnormality can be due to a physical extra electrical pathway such as that seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, or it can be due to changes in the electrical physiology between a few cells, like in atrial flutter.<n><n>title: , source: Rapid heart rates can also occur because of environmental issues that affect the heart. These can be intrinsic to the body, like anemia, abnormal electrolyte levels, or abnormal thyroid hormone levels. They may also be due to reactions to outside influences like caffeine, alcohol, over-the-counter cold remedies, or stimulants such as amphetamines. To the cardiac muscle cell, they all appear to be adrenaline-like substances that can cause cell irritation. Slow dysrhythmias can also be problematic. If the heart beats too slowly, the body may not be able to maintain adequate blood pressure and supply the body's organs with enough oxygen-rich blood to function. Slow heart rates may be due to the aging of the SA node and its inability to generate an electrical pacemaker signal. Often though, it is due to the side effects of medications used to control high blood pressure. Side effects of beta-blockers and certain calcium channel blocker drugs include a slowing of the heart rate. The body environment is also important with slow heart rhythm abnormalities. Hypothermia, or low body temperature, is a potential cause.  1 in 6 Kids Haven't Gotten All of Their Vaccines. Why? Kids Who Plant Themselves in Front of TV More Likely to Have Metabolic Syndrome as Adults EPA Awards $58 Million to Help Schools, Daycare Centers Remove Lead From Drinking Water Dementia Patients Wind up in the ER 1.4 Million Times a Year, Study Shows Many people may have heart rhythm disturbances and never be aware of them. Premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are variations of normal and most often, people are unaware that an extra beat has occurred. However, some patients are keenly aware of any extra heartbeat, even if it is a normal variant and requires no treatment. That said, the initial symptom of dysrhythmia is often palpitations, a sensation that the heart is beating too quickly, too slowly, beating irregularly, or skipping a beat. The palpitations may be intermittent or may require medical intervention to resolve.<n><n>title: , source: The heart has four chambers. The upper chambers are the right and left atria (singular = atrium) while the lower chambers are the right and left ventricles. The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs while the left side pumps it to the rest of the body. Blood from the body depleted of oxygen and containing carbon dioxide is collected in the right atrium and then pushed into the right ventricle with a small beat of the upper chamber of the heart. The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen and release carbon dioxide. The oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium where the small atrial beat pushes it to the left ventricle. The left ventricle is much thicker than the right because it needs to be strong enough to send blood to the entire body. There are special cells in the right atrium called the sinoatrial node (SA node) that generate the first electrical impulse, allowing the heart to beat in a coordinated way. The SA node is considered the "natural pacemaker" of the heart. This pacemaker function begins the electrical impulse, which follows pathways in the atrial walls, almost like wiring, to a junction box between the atrium and ventricle called the atrioventricular node (AV node). This electric signal causes muscle cells in both atria to contract at once. At the AV node, the electric signal waits for a very short time, usually one- to two-tenths of a second, to allow blood pumped from the atria to fill up the ventricles. The signal then passes through electric bundles in the ventricle walls to allow these chambers to contract, again in a coordinated way, and pump blood to the lungs and body. The SA node generates an electric beat about 60 to 80 times a minute, and each should result in a heartbeat. That beat can be felt as an external pulse. After a heartbeat, the muscle cells of the heart need a split second to get ready to beat again, and the electrical system allows a pause for this to happen.<n><n>User: Please give an answer in just one sentence.
