Social Security can help your family if you have earned enough Social Security credits through your work. You can earn up to four credits each year. In 2019 , for example , you earn one credit for each $1,360 of wages or self - employment income. When you have earned $5,440 , you have earned your four credits for the year. The number of credits needed to provide benefits for your survivors depends on your age when you die. No one needs more than 40 credits 10 years of work to be eligible for any Social Security benefit. But , the younger a person is , the fewer credits they must have for family members to receive survivors benefits. Benefits can be paid to your children and your spouse who is caring for the children even if you don't have the required number of credits. They can get benefits if you have credit for one and one - half years of work 6 credits in the three years just before your death.  For Your Widow Or Widower <n>There are about five million widows and widowers receiving monthly Social Security benefits based on their deceased spouse's earnings record.

When you do , it could mean a higher benefit for you in the future. Each year we review the records for all working Social Security recipients. If your earnings for the prior year are higher than one of the years we used to compute your retirement benefit , we will recalculate your benefit amount. We pay the increase retroactive to January the year after you earned the money. Higher benefits can be important to you later in life and increase the future benefit amounts your family and your survivors could receive. <n><n>How Much Can I Earn And Still Get Benefits? <n>If you are younger than full retirement age and make more than the yearly earnings limit , your earnings may reduce your benefit amount. (Full retirement age is 66 for people born between 1943 and 1954. Beginning with 1955, two months are added for every birth year until the full retirement age reaches 67 for people born in 1960 or later.) If you are under full retirement age for the entire year , we deduct $1 from your benefit payments for every $2 you earn above the annual limit. For 2019 , that limit is $17,640.<n><n>User: Please give an answer in just one sentence.

The higher your earnings were , the higher their benefits would be. We calculate a basic amount as if you had reached full retirement age at the time you die. These are examples of monthly benefit payments : Widow or widower, full retirement age or older 100 percent of your benefit amount ; Widow or widower , age 60 to full retirement age 71 to 99 percent of your basic amount ; Disabled widow or widower , age 50 through 59 71 percent ; Widow or widower , any age, caring for a child under age 16 75 percent ; A child under age 18 19 if still in elementary or secondary school or disabled 75 percent ; and Your dependent parent , age 62 or older : One surviving parent 82 percent. Two surviving parents 75 percent to each parent. Percentages for a surviving divorced spouse would be the same as above. There may also be a special lump - sum death payment.  Maximum Family Amount <n>There's a limit to the amount that family members can receive each month. The limit varies , but it is generally equal to between 150 and 180 percent of the basic benefit rate. If the sum of the benefits payable to family members is greater than this limit , the benefits will be reduced proportionately.

Other Things You Need To Know <n>There are limits on how much survivors may earn while they receive benefits. Benefits for a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse may be affected by several additional factors : If you remarry before you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , you cannot receive benefits as a surviving spouse while you are married. If you remarry after you reach age 60 age 50 if disabled , you will continue to qualify for benefits on your deceased spouse's Social Security record. If you receive benefits as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse , you can switch to your own retirement benefit as early as age 62. This assumes you are eligible for retirement benefits and your retirement rate is higher than your rate as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse. In many cases , a widow or widower can begin receiving one benefit at a reduced rate and then, at full retirement age, switch to the other benefit at an unreduced rate. If you will also receive a pension based on work not covered by Social Security, such as government or foreign work , your Social Security benefits as a survivor may be affected. <n><n>title: , source: For Your Parents <n>If you are the dependent parent , who is at least age 62 , of a worker who dies , you may be eligible to receive Social Security survivors benefits. You must have been receiving at least half of your support from your working child and you must not be eligible to receive a retirement benefit that is higher than the benefit we could pay on your child s record. Generally, you must not have married after your deceased adult child s death ; however, there are some exceptions. Besides being the natural parent , you could also be the stepparent, or the adoptive parent if you became the deceased worker s parent before he or she was age 16.  Survivors Benefit Amount <n>Your survivors benefit amount is based on the earnings of the person who died. The more they paid into Social Security , the higher your benefits would be. The monthly amount you would get is a percentage of the deceased's basic Social Security benefit. It depends on your age and the type of benefit you are eligible to receive. If the person who died was receiving reduced benefits , we base your survivors benefit on that amount. These are examples of the benefits that survivors may receive : Widow or widower, full retirement age or older 100 percent of the deceased worker's benefit amount ; Widow or widower , age 60 full retirement age 71 to 99 percent of the deceased worker's basic amount ; Disabled widow or widower aged 50 through 59 71 percent ; Widow or widower , any age, caring for a child under age 16 75 percent ; A child under age 18 19 if still in elementary or secondary school or disabled 75 percent ; and Dependent parent of the deceased worker, age 62 or older : One surviving parent 82 percent.

The higher your earnings were , the higher their benefits would be. We calculate a basic amount as if you had reached full retirement age at the time you die. These are examples of monthly benefit payments : Widow or widower, full retirement age or older 100 percent of your benefit amount ; Widow or widower , age 60 to full retirement age 71 to 99 percent of your basic amount ; Disabled widow or widower , age 50 through 59 71 percent ; Widow or widower , any age, caring for a child under age 16 75 percent ; A child under age 18 19 if still in elementary or secondary school or disabled 75 percent ; and Your dependent parent , age 62 or older : One surviving parent 82 percent. Two surviving parents 75 percent to each parent. Percentages for a surviving divorced spouse would be the same as above. There may also be a special lump - sum death payment.  Maximum Family Amount <n>There's a limit to the amount that family members can receive each month. The limit varies , but it is generally equal to between 150 and 180 percent of the basic benefit rate. If the sum of the benefits payable to family members is greater than this limit , the benefits will be reduced proportionately. Any benefits paid to a surviving divorced spouse based on disability or age won't count toward this maximum amount. Get your online or check our Benefit Calculators for an estimate of the benefits your family could receive if you died right now. <n><n>title: , source: For Your Surviving Divorced Spouse <n>If you have a surviving divorced spouse , they could get the same benefits as your widow or widower provided that your marriage lasted 10 years or more. Benefits paid to a surviving divorced spouse won't affect the benefit amounts your other survivors will receive based on your earnings record. If your former spouse is caring for your child who is under age 16 or disabled and gets benefits on your record , they will not have to meet the length - of - marriage rule. The child must be your natural or legally adopted child.  For Your Children <n>Your unmarried children who are under 18 up to age 19 if attending elementary or secondary school full time can be eligible to receive Social Security benefits when you die. And your child can get benefits at any age if they were disabled before age 22 and remain disabled.

The monthly amount you would get is a percentage of the deceased's basic Social Security benefit. It depends on your age and the type of benefit you are eligible to receive. If the person who died was receiving reduced benefits , we base your survivors benefit on that amount. These are examples of the benefits that survivors may receive : Widow or widower, full retirement age or older 100 percent of the deceased worker's benefit amount ; Widow or widower , age 60 full retirement age 71 to 99 percent of the deceased worker's basic amount ; Disabled widow or widower aged 50 through 59 71 percent ; Widow or widower , any age, caring for a child under age 16 75 percent ; A child under age 18 19 if still in elementary or secondary school or disabled 75 percent ; and Dependent parent of the deceased worker, age 62 or older : One surviving parent 82 percent.

This assumes you are eligible for retirement benefits and your retirement rate is higher than your rate as a widow, widower, or surviving divorced spouse.
