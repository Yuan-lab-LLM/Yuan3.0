However, it is etiquette that if the baby does start to make noise that you take it to the "deck" area beyond the doors (where the bathrooms, telephone, vending machines, etc.) are. This is the same protocol if you have to make or receive a telephone call, want to have a loud conversation with your seatmate, or do anything that might disturb other passengers. I should note that this has nothing to do with the green car -- the main cars nominally operate under these protocols, it's just that the other passengers (and conductors) are less likely to enforce them.<n><n>User: Please give an answer in just one sentence.

Also they are trying to establish the person's premise for visiting the UK and sometimes if a person is travelling with a group the info can be useful. Finally, the info is helpful in understanding the applicant's connection to the UK (if there is one) and if their visit is contingent on another person getting a visa. Based upon what you wrote, you are travelling with a friend/companion. You would answer the question honestly and check the 'NO' box if the person does not have a valid UK visa. Optionally, you can then go to Part 9 of the form and enter a brief explanation of how and when your friend/companion will apply for their visa. In fact you can simply reword your text above (i.e., your question) and copy it to Part 9. It is OK to be explicit about your relationship with your friend/companion because it helps establish the premise of both your visits.<n><n>User: Please give an answer in just one sentence.

Each time you cross an external border, you should get a stamp with a date on it. The day you got an entry stamp, the day you got an exit stamp and every day between them each count as one day towards the 90-day limit. So if you enter and leave immediately, or during the same calendar day, it counts as one day, whether it's a day trip, en errand to run, a layover or what not. In fact, if you enter 1 hour before midnight and leave 2 hours later, then your passport would show two days of stay in the Schengen area. On the other hand, if you can transit without leaving the transit lounge/“international” area of the airport (and major European airports are set up to allow that in many cases), it doesn't matter. You won't (need to) go through an official border check or be admitted to the Schengen area and won't get a stamp so there is no need to count days. But if your route includes a flight between two Schengen airports or you somehow need to go “landside”, you have to go through the border check and get a stamp.<n><n>User: Please give an answer in just one sentence.
