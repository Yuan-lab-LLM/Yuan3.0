The film was distributed by Warner Bros. "Dunkirk" portrays the evacuation from three perspectives: land, sea, and air. It has little dialogue, as Nolan sought instead to create suspense from cinematography and music. Filming began in May 2016 in Dunkirk and ended that September in Los Angeles, when post-production began. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot the film on IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film stock.<n><n>title: Dunkirk (2017 film) | Introduction, source: "Dunkirk" has extensive practical effects, and employed thousands of extras as well as historic boats from the evacuation, and period aeroplanes.

Nolan considered improvising the entire film instead of writing a script, but Thomas convinced him otherwise. In 2015, Nolan wrote a 76-page screenplay, which was about half the length of his usual scripts and his shortest to date. Its precise structure necessitated fictional characters, rather than ones based on eyewitnesses. The story is told from three perspectives—land (one week of action), sea (one day of action), and air (one hour of action).<n><n>User: when will the new dunkirk film be released on dvd<n><n>Assistant: 18 December 2017<n><n>User: Answer the following questions in JUST a few words or one sentence. what is this film about?<n><n>Assistant:<n><n>

From 1660 to 1792 Urk and Emmeloord belonged to the municipality of Amsterdam, and ruled from 1660 to 1672/1678 by Andries de Graeff. From 1792 to 1950 Urk belonged to the province of Noord-Holland. From 1950 to 1986 Urk belonged to the province of Overijssel. Since 1986, Urk has belonged to the province of Flevoland. After WWII, Urk's town spread into the polder. Many Urkers who had to leave the town because of overcrowding before the polder reclamation was completed were able to return to Urk. The Noordoostpolder in its early years had an alternative name "Urker Land," from which Urk's newspaper, "Het Urkerland", gets its name.<n><n>title: Ehursag | Introduction, source: The Ehursag at Ur was restored in 1961 using ancient and modern bricks, a 2008 report for the British Museum noted that this had collapsed in some areas, especially the northwest corner.<n><n>title: Urk | History / Lordship of Urk en Emmeloord, source: The oldest instance of the name "Urk" is a donation certificate of 966 from Holy Roman Emperor Otto I to the Sint Pantaleonsklooster monastery in Cologne. The text reads: "cuiisdam insulae medietatem in Almere, que Urch vocatur" (Latin: "of a certain island in the middle of Almere, which is called Urch"). Until 1475 the High and Low Lordship of Urk and Emmeloord (the most northern village of Schokland) was in the hands of the Van Kuinre family. From 1475 to 1614, the Zoudenbalch family of Utrecht were Lords of Urk and Emmeloord. From 1614 to 1660, Urk and Emmeloord were ruled by Jonkheer van der Werve.<n><n>title: Aartswoud | History, source: This later became "Aertswoud" (1450) with variant spellings for the initial vowel sounds, and finally Aartswoud. An edict from 1404 mandates that the dike at Aartswoud should always be able to be breached in case of an emergency; this happened in 1573, during the Siege of Alkmaar, when polders in the area of the Spanish encampment were flooded. The village was the location of some excitement in 1799 when, during the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, Batavian commander Herman Willem Daendels charged at a troop of British soldiers led by Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart, and captured twenty men and thirteen horses.<n><n>title: Urk | Introduction, source: Urk () is a municipality and a town in the Flevoland province in the central Netherlands. Urk is first mentioned in historical records dating to the 10th century, when it was still an island in the IJsselmeer, a lake that would become part of the Zuiderzee in the 13th century after a series of incursions by the North Sea. In 1939, a dike from the mainland to Urk ended the town's island status, just as the Afsluitdijk project was changing the salt water Zuiderzee surrounding Urk to the less saline IJsselmeer. Later in the 20th century, seabed areas surrounding Urk were reclaimed from the sea and became the Noordoostpolder.<n><n>User: what is this film about?<n><n>Assistant: Dunkirk evacuation of World War II<n><n>User: can you mention a few members of the cast?<n><n>Assistant: Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Jack Lowden, Harry Styles<n><n>User: where was it shot?<n><n>Assistant: Dunkirk and Urk, Netherlands<n><n>User: Answer the following questions in JUST a few words or one sentence. can you tell me anything about the latter place's past?<n><n>Assistant:<n><n>

Religious life has also traditionally been very important to Urk's inhabitants, with active, conservative congregations of the Dutch Reformed denominations playing key roles in the life of the community.<n><n>title: Urk | Economy, source: The important economic pillar of the village is the fishery. After the IJsselmeer was formed, the Urkers fished on the North Sea. Due to rising prices of fish, at present Urk is a very prosperous village. In the past, many lives were lost in storms on the Zuiderzee and North Sea. There is a memorial to lost fishermen on Urk, popularly known as the "Urker vrouw": a statue of a woman looking out to sea, vainly awaiting the return of her husband and sons.<n><n>title: Ulubey, Ordu | Economy, source: The economy of the district depends mainly on agriculture. Hazelnuts, beekeeping, dairy farming, corn, and kale are the main products. In recent decades the population has declined as people have migrated away to jobs in Turkey's larger cities or abroad, now mainly their grandparents remain.<n><n>title: Aalsmeer | Economy, source: Dominating the Ringvaart canal are the large building halls of Royal De Vries Scheepsbouw.

Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole, mackerel, herring, pouting, sprat, and sandeel are all very common and are fished commercially. Due to the various depths of the North Sea trenches and differences in salinity, temperature, and water movement, some fish such as blue-mouth redfish and rabbitfish reside only in small areas of the North Sea. Crustaceans are also commonly found throughout the sea. Norway lobster, deep-water prawns, and brown shrimp are all commercially fished, but other species of lobster, shrimp, oyster, mussels and clams all live in the North Sea.<n><n>title: North Sea | Fish and shellfish, source: Recently non-indigenous species have become established including the Pacific oyster and Atlantic jackknife clam.<n><n>title: North Sea | Marine mammals, source: The North Sea is also home to marine mammals. Common seals, and harbour porpoises can be found along the coasts, at marine installations, and on islands. The very northern North Sea islands such as the Shetland Islands are occasionally home to a larger variety of pinnipeds including bearded, harp, hooded and ringed seals, and even walrus. North Sea cetaceans include various porpoise, dolphin and whale species.<n><n>title: Fowlsheugh | Marine life, source: In the North Sea waters at the base of the cliffs can be found certain marine mammals, including the common seal ("Phoca vitulina") and the grey seal ("Halichoerus grypus"). Seals can be observed in summer months hauling out on the rugged rock formation of Craiglethy Skerry. Further offshore are frequently sighted dolphins. Bony fishes found in the offshore waters include Atlantic shad ("Aosa sapidissima"), Atlantic salmon ("Salmo salar"), and brown trout ("Salmo trutta"). Marine algae occurring immediately offshore at the Fowlsheugh Nature Reserve include "Dudresnaya verticillata", "Sauvageaugloia griffithsiana", and "Streblonema infestans".<n><n>title: North Sea | Biodiversity and conservation, source: Due to the heavy human populations and high level of industrialization along its shores, the wildlife of the North Sea has suffered from pollution, overhunting, and overfishing. Flamingos and pelicans were once found along the southern shores of the North Sea, but became extinct over the 2nd millennium. Walruses frequented the Orkney Islands through the mid-16th century, as both Sable Island and Orkney Islands lay within its normal range. Gray whales also resided in the North Sea but were driven to extinction in the Atlantic in the 17th century Other species have dramatically declined in population, though they are still found.<n><n>User: can you tell me anything about the latter place's past?<n><n>Assistant: Until 1475 the High and Low Lordship of Urk and Emmeloord was in the hands of the Van Kuinre family<n><n>User: what does the economy of this place depend upon?<n><n>Assistant: Fishery<n><n>User: is there any waterbody nearby ?<n><n>Assistant: North Sea<n><n>User: Answer the following questions in JUST a few words or one sentence. what kind of marine organisms are found in this sea?<n><n>Assistant:<n><n>

Vanadium is concentrated by some tunicates for use in their blood cells to a level ten million times that of the surrounding seawater. Other tunicates similarly concentrate niobium and tantalum. Lobsters use copper in their respiratory pigment hemocyanin, despite the proportion of this metal in seawater being minute. Although these elements are present in vast quantities in the ocean, their extraction by man is not economic.<n><n>title: Fowlsheugh | Marine life, source: In the North Sea waters at the base of the cliffs can be found certain marine mammals, including the common seal ("Phoca vitulina") and the grey seal ("Halichoerus grypus").

The manufacture of industrial minerals involves a complex solution mining operation in which naturally occurring brines are pumped from wells completed in several salt beds. The brine wells range in depth from near-surface to over below the salt pan. A network of production wells, injection wells, solar ponds and piping are used in the production and treatment of the brines. Industrial minerals are extracted from the brines at the Argus, Trona and Westend plants. Minerals are crystallized from the brines, screened, washed, and dried.<n><n>User: what does the economy of this place depend upon?<n><n>Assistant: Fishery<n><n>User: is there any waterbody nearby ?<n><n>Assistant: North Sea<n><n>User: what kind of marine organisms are found in this sea?<n><n>Assistant: Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole, mackerel, herring, pouting, sprat, and sandeel<n><n>User: Answer the following questions in JUST a few words or one sentence. what kind of minerals are found in this sea?<n><n>Assistant:<n><n>

Unlike the soft, rapidly eroding cliffs further east, the coast of the SSSI has shown a less consistent pattern, with a net accretion of beach material between 1880 and 1950. However, this coastline is threatened by climate change, with sea level rising an estimated 1–2 mm per year for the last 100 years, increasing the risk of flooding and coastal erosion. Half the area of the salt marshes that formed in the lee of Scolt Head Island has been reclaimed in the last 300 years, creating ecologically important, but very fragile, grazing marshes.<n><n>title: Storm tides of the North Sea | Introduction, source: Storm tides of the North Sea are coastal floods associated with extratropical cyclones crossing over the North Sea, the severity of which are affected by the shallowness of the sea and the orientation of the shoreline relative to the storm's path, as well as the timing of tides. The water level can rise to more than 5 metres (17 ft) above the normal tide as a result of storm tides. Northern Germany and Denmark are particularly susceptible to storm tides. The coastline of the German Bight forms an L-shape facing northwest. Also vulnerable are the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, where the sea shallows and is funnelled toward the English Channel.<n><n>title: North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest | Threats, source: The underlying geology of the North Norfolk coast is Cretaceous chalk, exposed at Hunstanton cliffs just to the west of the SSSI, but for the entire length of the SSSI coast, the chalk is buried by soft Quaternary glacial debris. Unlike the rapidly eroding soft cliffs further east, the coast of the SSSI has shown a less consistent pattern, with a net accretion of beach material between 1880 and 1950. This coastline is threatened by climate change, with sea level rising an estimated at 1–2 mm per year for the last 100 years, increasing the risk of flooding and coastal erosion.<n><n>title: Holkham National Nature Reserve | Threats, source: This may affect the movement of sediment, and lead to some erosion of the dunes and beaches at Holkham, but should not destroy their effectiveness as a sea defence unless the island reattaches to the mainland at some date in the distant future.<n><n>User: is there any waterbody nearby ?<n><n>Assistant: North Sea<n><n>User: what kind of marine organisms are found in this sea?<n><n>Assistant: Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole, mackerel, herring, pouting, sprat, and sandeel<n><n>User: what kind of minerals are found in this sea?<n><n>Assistant: Sand, gravel and rolled pieces of amber<n><n>User: Answer the following questions in JUST a few words or one sentence. does this place experiences any natural hazards?<n><n>Assistant:<n><n>
